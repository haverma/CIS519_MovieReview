and what an epitaph it is . . . by their nature , most love stories are relentlessly optimistic . an upbeat tone and a happy ending are almost mandatory . this motion picture is an examination of both the power and the impotence of love . neither is it an unqualified gateway to salvation . as it turns out , though , what he needs more than sex is a friendly ear . the audience understands when sera says , " we both realized that we didn't have that much time . he needed me . i loved him--i really loved him . " leaving las vegas wouldn't be as difficult to sit through--equal parts transcendent beauty and unbearable pain--if it weren't for a pair of magnificent performances . since this is essentially a two- character story , nearly every scene is built around ben , sera , or ( more frequently ) both . actor nicolas cage , who has a track record of immersing himself in parts , gives one of the year's most powerful acting turns . in this movie , the charisma and outward energy form a fragile shell over a pit of despair and self-loathing . yet at the same time , there's a sense of freedom--for ben , death has lost its power to frighten . cage melds all those elements into this complex , multi- layered portrayal . meanwhile , elisabeth shue , whose filmography is far less impressive , matches cage scene-for-scene , emotion-for-emotion . there's no glamour in this role , but we still see the beauty that attracts ben--tarnished and dulled , perhaps , but still obviously there . rarely does a motion picture create such conflicting emotions in the viewer . it doesn't moralize about its characters . like great poetry where each verse strives for new highs and lows , leaving las vegas draws its audience along a rarely-traveled path whose scope can only be fully appreciated in the silence of the aftermath . 
i feel like i've just taken a time trip back to the '80s . well , they're back again , and stronger than ever . scream started this recent wave , and its $100+ million box office gross has ensured a host of sequels and inferior copycats . i know what you did last summer , brought to the screen by neophyte director jim gillespie , is the second , and there are many more to come . i know what you did last summer bears almost all the hallmarks of a classic slasher movie . the large-breasted female protagonist does some incredibly dumb things . every character is strictly one-dimensional -- there's no desire or attempt to form anything resembling a full-fledged personality out of any of these cardboard stereotypes . there's plenty of blood and gore ( although , to be fair , one could argue that it's restrained here ) . the only thing that's missing are flashes of female flesh . gratuitous nudity was always big in the '80s films . apparently , that's no longer the case . of course , the killer has to be dressed in some kind of costume -- that's a slasher movie requisite . in scream , it was the grim reaper . so what face of terror do we have in i know what you did last summer ? that's right -- rain slicker , hat , and all . i kept expecting to hear the theme song playing in the background . the screenwriter of i saw what you did last summer is kevin williamson , who made a name for himself by penning scream . those two movies give him a unique distinction . with i saw what you did last summer , he has now written a film of the very type that his other script parodied . scream had a lot of fun playing with ideas , conventions , and approaches that i saw what you did last summer takes very seriously . and the genuine scares of scream have mostly been replaced by silly , repetitive shock tactics ( one exception : a creepy cat-and-mouse game in a department store ) . this points out the main weakness of i saw what you did last summer . the characters aren't interesting enough for us to be scared for them . they just add to the body count , and everyone knows that the really good slasher movies have inordinately high death rates . the story sounds more interesting that it is . i wasn't dazzled by any of the acting in this film , but it's rare that a slasher movie is characterized by oscar-caliber performances . there is one minor aspect of the plot that elevates i saw what you did last summer above the level of a typical '80s slasher flick -- it has an interesting subtext . sadly , this potentially-fascinating element of the movie is dismissed quickly to facilitate a higher body count . and , as i said before , a few extra deaths can only make a slasher movie better , right ? " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
the problem with the film , as an original and diverting story as it is , is that it is also too confusing to follow and suffers from a sense that it is too " hip " for its own good . but even as the film failed to add up to being as good as it could have been , it was still entertaining and visually engaging . i began to enjoy the film more for its style , which is the only way to view it . it was shot in such exacting detail , its colorful sets becoming a feast for the eyes that were ready to experience visions not seen in other sci-fi films , it also allowed for a certain pleasure to be induced from overhearing the odd conversations that were inane but fun to listen to . fox's haiku is a good example of the meaningful nonsense the film conveyed , as he recites to x the poem he just wrote : but something mysterious soon happens and the last 20 minutes of the film repeats what happened so far , but adding new details and a different way of looking at it . the murky ending will not be pleasing to most viewers , as they try to make sense of what is happening . 
parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . - ingmar bergman 
this film is all style and is non-judgmental in its observations , adding nothing more of subtance to the story than the inertia that is depicted . there is violence everywhere in this stupid household . the film had realistic performances from its leads and had a gritty look to it . but the story flattened out and with violence being the loudest emotion expressed by anyone in this loser's family , the story predictably ends on a very violent note . the film makes no comments about the conditions of a society that helped bring about such anti-social behavior and what circumstances kept the family incapicitated . this first feature by woods , based on a work that was presented on stage , had its powerful moments , making a strong case about how male insecurity and violence are so closely linked . but the film couldn't get further into its subjects than to expose the boys' surface wounds and their bleak story about their frustrations to deal with life , as the story just went nowhere but down a predictable violent path . it left the implication that society better be prepared to build more jails or else , implying that there is no way to help a family that won't even lift a finger to help itself . 
i have a confession to make which may compromise my integrity as a reviewer ( if that isn't an oxymoron ) : i wanted the good son to be horrible . * really * horrible . i've grown so tired of macaulay culkin's yelping mug and the highly-publicized power grabs by his manager-dad , that i wanted him to be wholly responsible for a colossal failure . well , the good son isn't horrible ; it's merely mediocre , which may be worse . at least a truly awful thriller can provoke campy laughs . all the good son provoked in me was boredom . i had very little problem with the basic premises of the good son . the problems with the good son are almost entirely in the execution . the film waits far too long , nearly a third of its running time , before introducing us to henry , setting up mark's guilt and showing off desert scenery . there's no time for the menace to build slowly , or for the early pranks to be tame enough so that mark could get a bit caught up in them himself . ian mcewan's script seemed to need another draft and earlier plot points . the performances are also a big problem . elijah wood is fine , a good young actor forced to spend most of this film making his eyes as wide as possible . his relatives , however , don't fare as well . we're never specifically told how long it has been since the death of the other son , and that would have helped . as it is , wallace seems perfectly recovered , while susan appears simply melancholy , striking bronte-esque poses on a seaside promontory . this is also parly the fault of a performance by culkin lacking in subtlety . instead of the straightforward tone of a true sociopath , culkin adopts the wide-eyed , solemn , sing-song style any parent would instantly recognize as a child lying . it's homicidal that he hasn't quite mastered . if there's one surprising culprit in the good son's failings , it's director joseph ruben . but the good son goes everywhere you expect it to go , exactly when you expect it . it's a competent but cut-and-paste directing job , providing the minimum recommended allowance of suspense . i never groaned out loud , but i never felt any real tension , either . the good son is not a complete failure . it's the kind of thriller where you might jump once , then wonder why you fell for * that * old bit . and as reluctant as i am to admit it , culkin shows that he might be more than a one-trick pony given a little seasoning . it just might be a good idea if his next trick is something original . 
with all apologies to it's a wonderful life and miracle on 34th street , charles dickens' a christmas carol is probably the best-loved , most often retold christmas story of them all . there's something in its message of spiritual rebirth and redemption that strikes a responsive chord in all of us , especially in an age when the focus of the holiday season has shifted more to material goods than altruism . most everyone , i'm sure , recognizes a little bit of scrooge in themselves . the best production of all was the 1951 black-and-white classic with alistair sim as the detestable skinflint . it can be debated at endless length whether it's a good idea to inject song-and-dance numbers into dickens' tale . purists probably don't like it , but if it can be done with victor hugo's les miserables , there's no reason why it can't succeed with a christmas carol . so , the problem with scrooge isn't the concept itself as much as the execution . even though bricusse was given an oscar nomination for the movie , the songs ( with one exception : " thank you very much " ) are instantly forgettable . unlike the great musicals , where you might find yourself humming a tune a few days later , with scrooge , you'll be lucky if you remember the name of one of the songs a few hours later . the screenplay is faithful to the original story . of all the scrooges to pass across the screen , none has been as convincing or memorable as alistair sim . albert finney , one of today's best character actors , places himself somewhere in the middle of the pack with this hammy , albeit enjoyable , portrayal . if there's a standout performance in scrooge , it belongs to alec guinness , who turns in an unconventionally energetic and sadistically high-spirited version of jacob marley's ghost . never before nor since has marley been played with such a bizarre mixture of the nasty and the good-natured . kenneth more is suitably jovial and larger-than-life as the boisterous ghost of christmas present . scrooge is basically a harmless , fitfully enjoyable version of the timeless classic , and worth a look for those who have had their fill of the more serious adaptations . it's entirely suitable for family viewing and , if the mood tends to become a little too sweet at times , keep in mind the season it was designed for . 
in the rage : carrie 2 , robert mandel's terminally bland sequel to carrie , there isn't a single original moment . only amy irving returns from carrie , and the talent of the rest of the sequel's cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu's script . as rachel , the horror story's lead , emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory , but it isn't exactly her fault . the director asks for little from his actors , which is precisely what he gets . sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie , rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open , but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim . as the movie marks time until its big finale , it throws in some repugnant scenes , hoping to turn audience's stomachs . the teenagers in the movie are completely blas ? about it all . " doesn't it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday , " asks one of the few kids with a conscience . " why ? " remarkably devoid of any energy , especially for a horror flick , the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theater's armrest . with material this bad , the film's only hope is to go for parody , but it isn't smart enough to realize it . even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie . it is rated r for graphic violence , teen alcohol abuse , sex , nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers . 
screenplay : al franken . director : harold ramis . it is really as simple as that . we can only find evidence of a benevolent god in the fact that hans & franz the movie and coffee talk the movie were scrapped in development ( that is not a joke ) . not only is this latest " saturday night live " character spinoff incoherent and unfunny , its basic idea and tone are just appallingly wrong-headed . they had their moments , primarily because al franken is one of the few performers associated with snl in the last decade who doesn't appear to have had all his subtlety surgically removed ; indeed , his sing-song delivery is good for the film's few laughs . mostly , it's just deadly slow . what is _unintentionally_ funny about stuart saves his family is the movie-of-the-week melodrama of the smalley family segments . although there are a few flashbacks to stuart's youth which are played strictly for laughs ( unsuccessfully ) , the majority of the interactions are intended to be poignant or serious . this decision is baffling , because franken appears to have forgotten the premise behind the " daily affirmation " sketches . they were parodies of the touchy-feely self-help movement , deriving most of their humor from goofy over-reliance on new age mantras like stuart's ubiquitous " and that's . . . the schizoid combination of humorless comedy and misplaced sentimentality ( including a score by the ever-more-saccharine marc shaiman ) makes for a truly uncomfortable ride . it is clear that al franken had two basic choices when it came to making a stuart movie : keep stuart a caricature in an episodic story , or make him more real in an actual narrative . big mistake . i said franken had two basic choices . make that three : he could have chosen not to do the movie at all . _that_ would have been the smart choice . 
there's bad buzz , and then there's the the bad buzz which surrounded the avengers , the kind that sounds like a swarm of africanized bees after a particularly vigorous hive-shaking . a gratuitous " f-word " had even been added to bump the rating from a pg to pg-13 . then , all the worst fears seemed to be confirmed when warner bros . announced that no advance screenings would be held for the media . you may think you're ready for the possibility that a film could be bad , but little can prepare you for something as pointless , smug and misguided as the avengers . it is the latter which proves most instantly and consistently grating in the avengers . ralph fiennes and uma thurman spend most of their scenes together engaging in a smirk throwing contest , each one trying to look the most amused with him or herself , eyebrows so prominently arched you're afraid someone might sprain something . this despite the fact that don macpherson's dialogue is a study in witlessness , tossing out embarrassing puns as though they were saucy enough to turn oscar wilde green with envy . though they generally appear content to let their wardrobe do most of the acting for them , fiennes and thurman should be commended for one impressive demonstration of dramatic skill : they're able to treat the most mundane comments as though they were nuggets of pure comic gold bestowed upon the world . that kind of quip-heavy self-awareness was certainly true of the namesake television series as well , so what's so wrong with this variation on the theme ? in short , both the personnel and the context . patrick macnee and diana rigg , the most celebrated of the series' pairings , shared a genuine chemistry which made the romantic tension fun to watch . fiennes and thurman appear far too enamored of their own charm and cleverness to bother connecting with one another . they're also dropped into a summer blockbuster milieu entirely inappropriate for light-hearted capering . imagine an episode of the old " batman " series with a $70 million budget , and you'll understand what's so wrong with the avengers . it's hard to endear yourself to an audience with low-tech campiness at the same time you're blowing something up every 10 minutes , or sending huge mechanical insects after our heroes like something out of the speeder bike chase from return of the jedi . we're long past the point of pretending that plot or character has anything to do with 1990s-model hollywood summer fare , so i won't even bother slapping the avengers around for exhibiting symptoms of that particular contagious disease . but such a film has to give you something to latch on to : engaging performers , effective pacing , a decent villain to hiss . not even sean connery , blustering about without the faintest idea why his character does anything , can pump up the charisma quotient of this tedious car wreck of a film . the closest recent analog to the avengers is batman and robin , but at least batman and robin had its sheer momenteum and comic-book gaudiness to salvage it . the avengers is just action sequences in search of a movie , actors in search of a reason to keep smirking . crimes against film audiences must be avenged ; the buzz of surly patrons coming out of the theater may be even more frightening than the buzz on the film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
disney's recent movie called flubber -- an underrated film that critics , except me , generally loathed but kids loved -- is a remake of the absent-minded professor starring fred macmurray as professor ned brainard . after seeing and liking robin williams in flubber , our family decided to check out the original . the original's simple humor looks remarkably tired compared with the story's energetic and much more inventive remake . moreover , the performances in the original , except those of fred macmurray and keenan wynn , as the villain alonzo hawk , are wooden . the professor's intended , nancy olson , for example , is played lethargically by betsy carlisle in the original . and although macmurray did a fine job , williams brought much more to the role . then again , weebo , the professor's companion in the remake outclasses poor charlie and garners an order of magnitude more laughs . the question confronting the professor , and the script writers , is " what can you do with flubber ? " in both film versions , the substance is used in a basketball game and as an alternative fuel for the professor's car . john hughes did the script for flubber , based on the original script by bill walsh and the book by samuel w . taylor . in the remake they simply find many more imaginative and comical things to do with flubber , not the least of which is a magical , synchronized dance number . even the parts that are the same in the two versions are so much more realistic , funny , and involving in flubber . even the simplest things are done particularly poorly in the original . the sounds effects during the big basketball game sound less like a real crowd than a swarm of droning bees . the talky comedy has less humor than it should and relatively few sight gags , amazing given the possibilities of flying rubber . the visuals of the flying tin lizzie are sweet , and the ending , where they finally put the bad guy in his place , does have the imagination that the rest of the picture too often lacks . although it is a genuinely charming comedy , the absent-minded professor is that rare original movie that made me yearn for its remake . it is not rated , but would be a g and is suitable for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thoughts it was a " really good movie . " he gave it * * * , and said he thought it was tied with flubber . he went on to comment that he liked the way that neither version was bloody . 
an even bigger surprise than the briefly pudgy roberts is that catherine zeta-jones , as gwen , turns out to be wonderful at comedy , playing a pampered bitch with great panache and perfect timing . gwen plays the crowd with great swagger and confidence , but she's hell on wheels when out of the public's view . hector , the film's silliest character , has a heavy accent . the story's challenge is a press junket without a movie since hal ( christopher walken ) , the iconoclastic director of gwen and eddie's last movie together , won't show anyone the picture until the press junket . this classic screwball comedy features four actors ( roberts , zeta-jones , cusack and crystal ) performing superbly . just like the press , all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the action in this wonderful blend of physical and written comedy . the real mystery is whether the film will ever show up , and , if it does , what it will be like . trust me . you will not be disappointed . it's hard to see how she won't get trampled in the jurassic park iii juggernaut . still , one thing is certain , this film is a real crowd pleaser with laughs so big and often that you're going to miss some of the lines . if you're more in the mood for laughs than action , go for america's sweethearts . you'll be glad you did . it is rated pg-13 for language , some crude and sexual humor and would be fine for kids around 10 and up . my son jeffrey , age 12 , who laughed long and hard , gave it * * * * . he said that it is one of the best films that he's seen lately . he said that it had two really good female comedians , but everyone was great . he commented too on how surprised he was that zeta-jones could do comedy so well . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
screenplay : hirokazu koreeda . producers : masayuki akieda and shiho sato . director : hirokazu koreeda . mpaa rating : unrated ( adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . hirokazu koreeda's after life is a film that stirs the imagination instantly -- which is fortunate , because the overflow of good will has to carry through an ill-conceived conclusion . the provocative premise combines the post-mortem bureaucracy of defending your life with a conversation from city slickers about the best days of one's life . the memories about which they speak are intriguing enough in their own right -- some with tales about childhood innocence , others with accounts of adult adventures -- to spark reflections by viewers about their own favored recollections . more intriguing still is after life's exploration of the nature of memory as a combination of things as they were and things as we wish they could have been . even the conceit of creating a film version of an imperfect memory -- rather than using the archived videotapes of people's lives available to the case workers -- emphasizes the power of filtered , romanticized remembrance . for over an hour , after life delights with reflections on what we remember and how we remember it , letting the steady stream of interviews flow over the loose narrative structure . in the course of helping watanabe -- who considers his life so mundane that there's not a moment worth remembering -- mochizuki struggles with unresolved issues from his own life . after spending most of the film as effective supporting players , the rosencrantzes and guildensterns of after life cold-cock this " hamlet " and make it all about them . there's nothing inherently wrong with a movie about the longings of otherworldly guides , unless you count the fact that it's already been done a few times . but after life shouldn't have been one of those movies , since it already had so much going for it as meditation on transcendent life experiences . there's a strange appeal to the production's heaven-as-low-budget-independent-film-set look , and plenty more appeal to the tales of the deceased . it's hard not to suspect that after life would have made an extraordinary documentary , since koreeda's steady , concentrated medium shots of the characters describing their memories are so effective . maybe then koreeda wouldn't have been tempted to leave the strengths of his film -- which are plenty strong -- for the supernatural melodrama of long-lost loves . in my memory , this one will linger as a good film that could have been great . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
in its present form , this is one of the least appealing movies of the year . it's not especially poorly made , but neither is it a masterpiece of modern film making . a dangerous woman has little to hold the viewer's interest , and its tone is so relentlessly downbeat that , at times , it becomes unpleasant to watch . perhaps the biggest flaw is characterization . i never cared about any of the three principals ( martha , mackey , and frances ) . for the most part , these people are dull and uninteresting , and it's a major mistake to build a motion picture around them . martha is especially disappointing . she rings false not because of her limitations , but because of the manner in which those limitations are presented . everything about them is too obvious ( no subtlety ) . the script is more at fault than the actors . barbara hershey and gabriel byre don't excel here , but their performances aren't without their moments . debra winger has a tendency to go overboard in her portrayal of martha , making mercedes ruehl's bella from lost in yonkers seem understated by comparison . some will probably be astounded by this example of overacting . personally , i think ms . winger would have been much more impressive had she applied some restraint . after the first few minutes , she becomes annoying . the tone and pacing of a dangerous woman are also problematic . the movie moves along sloooooowly , apparently going nowhere . when something actually happens , it's a surprise , but even the " big " events fail to generate much energy . the infrequent attempts at humor are bleak and unfunny , and a few " cute " scenes with martha generate almost no emotional response from the audience . there is also a huge missed opportunity . down this avenue lies the path of a potentially potent drama , but just as the film seems to be headed in the right direction , it takes a detour , and never gets back on track . all we're treated to after that is a mind-numbingly silly conclusion where suddenly everything is bright and glorious . the problem is , it's buried under too many layers of dross for more than a few hints of it to bubble to the surface . production-wise , there have been many movies of far worse quality , but there are few that match this one for lack of entertainment value . 
john carpenter , the master of horror flicks , including the original halloween , is back with an impressive and surprisingly good picture , which modestly goes by the full title of john carpenter's vampires . vampires , a film smart enough to never take itself seriously , is a fun romp of a motion picture . redefining and enlivening the vampire genre , carpenter blends in lavish doses of humor along with an intriguing story . if you're used to vampire pictures that work only at the shock level , you will likely find that vampires does everything but scare you . while you're not likely to be frightened , you will find yourself laughing and being wrapped up in the engrossing story . don jakoby's script , based on the novel " vampire$ " by john steakley , has a fascinating mix of mystery and humor . regardless of what you heard , we learn that vampires are not impressed with garlic or crosses . the winch will experience mechanical difficulties more than once , causing panic and humorous expletives . woods has a ball in a role that feeds him a stream of great one-liners and generally lets him ham it up . although bodies are indeed ripped apart in the gory fashion of traditional horror movies , carpenter pulls the camera away before we are too grossed out . it is more that she has a perverse form of non-consensual sex with valek . lee takes a part that could have been a cliche and makes her character instead sympathetic and smart . the film has a handsome look and great electronic guitar music . thankfully absent is the overabundance of special effects that most directors fall back on today . even if the demographics for vampire movies are normally limited , this one has the potential to please a wide variety of filmgoers since carpenter does such a masterful job of invigorating a moribund genre . although not quite as good as the vampire movie habit , just released this week on video , vampires is a wonderfully entertaining movie that will pleasantly surprise those who see it . it is rated r for horror film gore , profanity , sex and nudity and would be fine for older teenagers . 
with all of the hoopla surrounding the re-release of grease , i decided this was a good opportunity to review one of my all-time favorite musicals . after debating between high society and singing in the rain , i chose the former -- not necessarily because it's better , but because it isn't as well-known ( that should not in any way be confused with " obscure , " which this movie certainly isn't ) . the plot details and character names are the same for both versions , as are some of the lines of dialogue , but there is one critical difference : high society supplants the philadelphia story's excessive talkiness with nine top-notch musical numbers from cole porter . i'm probably one of the few critics who prefers the remake to the original , but high society is better-paced , more energetic , and generally more enjoyable . while it's true that some of the character interaction in this film isn't as pointed or witty , the musical component more than makes up for this deficiency . but the pre-wedding preparations do not go smoothly . there's a lot to like about high society . the romantic elements , while heartfelt , aren't overplayed . the film's dialogue , although lacking the full punch of that in the philadelphia story , is still delightful . however , the two chief pleasures of high society are the performances , which bring life and vitality to the characters , and the music , which makes this the kind of movie that never loses its appeal . sinatra and crosby have a fine , lively duet called " well , did you evah ? " armstrong gets the film off to a fine start with " high society , " a calypso song whose lyrics lay out the background of the story that is about to unfold . the musical highlight is without a doubt the armstrong/crosby duet " now you has jazz , " a lively tune guaranteed to get the feet tapping . unlike many musicals of the '50s , high society does not rely on grand production numbers or carefully-choreographed song-and-dance numbers . director charles walters keeps everything intentionally low- key . but , because the tunes are so well-written and the singers are so adept , there's no sense that anything is lacking . while bing crosby isn't as good a dexter as cary grant , the actor/singer still manages to develop a likable and sympathetic character who the audience instinctively roots for . high society is truly one of the great mgm musicals , and , watching it again reminded me how gimmicky and one-dimensional something like grease is . sure , the travolta/newton-john tribute to the '50s has pizzazz and enjoyable music , but the characters and situations are much less interesting that those found in singing in the rain or high society . high society doesn't just have a voice -- it has a heart and a soul as well .

with their medications they are coping with life well enough so that they are outpatients rather than residents . harry is played with sincere and touching emotions by john lynch . although they both have severe emotional problems , hers is worse so mckenzie's part proves the more challenging . confined to an important middle segment in the show , the sexual escapade is the central thread that convinces the audience of the strength of the lovers' commitment . first time director michael rymer , who also wrote the script , weaves a story full of inner truths and high energy . the way astral communicates is the most surprising aspect of angel baby . this is not done for comedic effect , but as a natural thing a mentally disturbed person might believe . up until this point the show had been touching and serious but upbeat . from the quotes and the situations you may think it is funny , but actually it is not . most would have been content to let them overact so they could have complete artistic freedom . by the end of the film , i was reduced to tears . this is a tragedy that is never manipulative and always genuine , and the heartfelt acting makes it a powerful movie . it is not rated but would get an r for the sex , nudity , and profanity . the film would be fine for serious and older teenagers . i recommend the movie to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
it is the kind of situation you might have seen before played for laughs in low-brow comedies , usually because one of the parties in the bathroom is not the bride or the groom . in one astonishing moment , however , von trier shows that he is not going to take you anywhere you have been before , allowing his hand-held camera to linger on the face of a woman whose reaction is nothing as simple as lust or anxiety . it is nothing less than awe at the overpowering emotions of making love for the first time which plays out before us , and introduces us to one of the most utterly fascinating film characters i have ever seen , played by an actor of unbelievable range . there is not an emotion she does not touch , or which does not leave you fumbling for superlatives . watson is so good that her performance might overwhelm a lesser story made by a lesser film-maker , but breaking the waves is no simple love story . that storyline alone would make breaking the waves a risky venture , but von trier takes it to another level of audacity by making it an exploration of love and religious faith at its most extreme . it is powerful , resonant , and not a little bit sacrilegious . and breaking the waves is nearly as likely to offend those of a liberal sensibility as those more conservatively inclined . those whose knees would jerk at the mere notion of a woman who would sacrifice anything for her man are going to have major problems with breaking the waves , yet the film's indescribable final shot may address outrage on both sides with wordless daring : our earthly notions of good and evil , of right and wrong , may be burdens that only a simple mind motivated only by love can overcome in order to know the will of god . breaking the waves , at once intellectually challenging and emotionally draining , is presented by lars von trier in a visual style he also used in the kingdom , a film-to-video-to-film trick which renders everything a dirty brown . that structure , along with the jittery photography , are as much a key to the title of breaking the waves as anything which occurs in the film . lars von trier takes his audience for a ride on a sea of emotions which cannot leave it unmoved . love it or loathe it , you will not be able to ignore breaking the waves , or the work of emily watson as a woman who proves that love is a mighty power . 
bruce willis , who costars with osment , delivers one of the strongest performances of his career and still manages to be upstaged by the talented youngster . " the most amazing child actor i've ever seen " is how willis refers to osment in the film's press notes . " i rank this kid up there with the best adult actors i've worked with over the years . " after seeing the child's brilliant work in this remarkable film , willis's observations are easy to agree with . the sixth sense , written and directed with subtly and grace by m . night shyamalan , doesn't fit neatly into any genre , no matter what the trailers might lead you to believe . perhaps the best way to define it is to say what it isn't . it's not a horror movie , although there are some frightening images . the script is too interior and intellectual to be considered a traditional thriller , but you will find yourself on the edge of your seat . the movie isn't a comedy even though there are plenty of appreciated opportunities for laughter to break the film's intensity . finally , it isn't a romance , but love is a major theme . so what is it ? any category you put it in would be needlessly limiting and inappropriate . suffice it to say that it's a film that will surprise and mesmerize you . it's the sort of film that's liable to elicit a " wow " at the conclusion . this review will give only the briefest of outline to the story , less than the trailers provide , so that there is no fear of revealing any of the fascinating details of the plot . " you're nice , but you can't help me , " cole tells malcolm . in his tenderest performance ever , willis shows his empathy for the boy's troubles . but is there any truth in this ? tak fujimoto's dark , intense cinematography reflects the somber tone of the two protagonists' troubles . the complex and rewarding script blends in a strong life-affirming aspect to the melancholy story . the touching film moves with great delicacy as it reveals its truths . the cinematic equivalent of a page-turner , the movie keeps your eyes glued to the screen . the writer respects the intelligence of the audience , saving the answers to many of the key questions that the story poses for as long as possible . as the ending credits roll , you'll be busy discussing the film with everyone around you . one subject of the conversation will undoubtedly be that you want to see it again . it's that good and that intriguing . the sixth sense runs 1 : 54 . it is rated pg-13 for intense thematic material and violent images and would be fine for teenagers . an r rating might have been more appropriate . 
it is allegedly based upon a true story , one that echoes the director's universal appeal for everyone to end all their hatred . the bitter war , seems almost to be inevitable in this over two hour film , told in a detached style , emphasizing the bloody battles , as it clearly shows how war is both hell and insanity . if the film could be faulted , it is that everyone in it is used as a symbol , which takes away some of the spontaneity of their individualism , so the characters don't really stick with us as much as the arson of the villages does and all the other catastrophes that result from the war . this is a disturbing film , not one that is easy to watch , even as its gallows humor tries to lessen the somber tone of the story . 
any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates . frankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director's greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement . unfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller . almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities . the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what's going on so that these flaws in logic don't become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled . unfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they're happening . this is a very bad sign . not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . of course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters . a perfect murder isn't a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott's play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock's version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) . not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they're not interesting . ( it's possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn't . ) steven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes . the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks . gwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here . at least viggo mortensen ( g . i . jane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end . there aren't many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start . it's surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living . it's just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
trial by jury is a thriller first and a courtroom drama second . all of these facts and much more including , i am sorry to report , a key twist at the end of the show you can learn by seeing the trailers as i have done already on 4 or 5 occasions . now , i ask you . does this sort of sound like a formula plot ? right you are and therein lies the major flaw in the film , the script . it is straight out of script writing 101 . in the first three quarters it has characters do very predictable things and do them s-l-o-w-l-y . this is only one of the small problems with the film's believability . i did not believe the characters during the first three quarters . just a bunch of actors reading formula dialog . in the last quarter , it just flat got ridiculous . i did not believe it at all . major suspension of disbelief is necessary to stay a believer till the end . he was miscast in his role , and the role was not written well or very bright . what a waste of a great actor . what the movie has going for it is two terrific looking leads in assante and whalley-kilmer . their looks and their acting i always find interesting . actually , i knew the show was in major trouble when a brief love scene involving whalley-kilmer , whom i think is one of the prettiest women on the planet , started to bore me and found me looking at my watch . even small details like assante's clothing provided intriguing images . finally , i must admit , that i love jury trial scenes even poorly done ones . they fascinate me . the movie runs about 2 hours and is rated r by the mpaa . there is a little nudity and a medium amount of violence . i think teenagers could see it if they like . on the other hand , i do not recommend the show to any age group , and i generously award it * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
did i mention that she has never really met david , except , that is , on television ? you see , david isn't real either . he is just the lead character in the popular soap opera , " a reason to love . " delightful playing bad soap star george mccord , kinnear is equally charming as george's television character , david . here we want betty and david , i mean george , to get together since both are so appealing . after all , david said on the television that " i just know that there's something really special out there for me , " and she knows that he must have been speaking about her . with a huge smile , betty has a childlike innocence . as george says to her , " your dedication scares me . " the surprising scene when they first meet is the most brightly written one in a script bursting with wonderfully imaginative scenes . the screenplay by john c . richards and james flamberg won the award as the best screenplay at this year's cannes international film festival . director labute , known for his demonic dramas ( in the company of men ) and caustic comedies ( your friends & neighbors ) , is one of my personal favorites . this , his third film , is the first time that he has worked from someone else's script . here , he proves , in case there was any doubt , that he's just as brilliant a director as he is a writer . and this being a labute film , there is an undercurrent of danger , as well as a bit of pathos . nevertheless , the film is an amazingly good-spirited one , especially for someone known for exploring people's darkest impulses . the cheerful cinematography by jean-yves escoffier ( good will hunting ) with its bright colors adds to the story's upbeat ambiance . the strong supporting cast has so many terrific performances that it is hard to pick a favorite , but mine might be allison janney ( american beauty ) as the soap's hard-nosed producer . i won't give away how nurse betty ends , but i thought it was perfect , especially its little epilog , which was icing on the cake . it is rated r for strong violence , pervasive language and a scene of sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
the only hint he uncovers is both obscure and ironic , but it doesn't help resolve the location of the children . the parents are an amalgamation of a wide variety of types , and , within the constraints of a normal length film , the writer manages to develop each remarkably well . murer , who was at our screening , clearly understands and appreciates children . his presentation of them is never patronizing or demeaning . he even did an impromptu magic trick that he used to entertain the child actors on the set . his treatment of the parents in the story is a bit more judgmental , but completely honest . the beauty of the film is that , as the conclusion draws nigh , the audience realizes that it has learned remarkably little . the busy , cathartic ending may be a bit much for some , but it nicely caps a most unusual tale . after the film concluded , the director poked fun at his own movie . " you can tell it isn't an american film -- no big stars , no happy ending , " he said . i told him that i respectfully disagreed about the ending . he smiled broadly and didn't argue with me . full moon runs 2 : 04 . it is not rated , but would be pg-13 for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 10 and up . 
cast : nathan lane , lee evans , christopher walken , vicki lewis , eric christmas , maury chaykin director : gore verbinski producers : alan riche , tony ludwig , bruce cohen screenplay : adam rifkin cinematography : phedon papamichael music : alan silvestri u . s . distributor : dreamworks skg you have to admire dreamworks' guts for using a mouse in a direct challenge to disney's family feature dominance ( in fact , not only do they use it , but they make jokes about using it ) . unfortunately , that's one of the few admirable things about mousehunt , a clever but surprisingly stale exercise in tedium that's supposed to pass for a slapstick-laden live cartoon . it's easy to see how the film makers thought they had a winning comedy on their hands , but the fatal flaw is in the design and execution , not the premise . much to their surprise , it turns out that both are worth a lot of money . on an intellectual level , i can appreciate the potential amusement value of a story in which a mouse outwits and beats up a group of inept human beings . the problem is , with all of its physical comedy , this movie is going for a more visceral appeal . to that end , it makes a serious mistake . mousehunt alienates the audience from all of the on- screen characters , and the distance is so great that it's difficult to care about any of the participants , regardless of whether they're four- legged or two-legged . this lack of involvement caused me to lose interest . it's also never clear whether the film makers' sympathies lie with the cute rodent or the smuntzes . who , if anyone , are we supposed to be rooting for ? the film's ambivalent approach saps the life out of any humor . some of the comic bits are inventive , but they're not funny . the film isn't as lifeless as mr . magoo , but i still didn't react more positively than with an occasional smile . seeing people fall through floors and get snapped by mouse traps is only entertaining if it's properly set up . that's why we laugh when wile e . coyote endures physical abuse , but not when the same things happen to nathan lane . magoo ) , and this one is more of a " miss " than a " hit " . mousehunt is a slapsticky 95 minutes filled with dull , obligatory comedy that may amuse children but is unlikely to enthrall adults . the special effects used to create the mouse are effective , with the antics of 60 real-life rodents and one animatronic creature seamlessly edited together by first-time feature director gore verbinski , who previously made the budweiser frog commercials . however , in today's marketplace , that's not much of an achievement . even christopher walken , playing a spoof of his usual creepy self , fails to generate much genuine humor . his performance , like the rest of the picture , seems recycled . - ingmar bergman 
so what's on your ideal movie checklist ? let's take a look at director luis mandoki's message in a bottle and see how it stacks up . check . with kevin costner , robin wright penn and paul newman , you've got them in spades . gorgeous images ? thanks to caleb deschanel's dazzling cinematography of glistening ocean waters and warm interior sets , you can put a big checkmark there . believable romantic chemistry ? another check . costner and penn are wonderful together and just as awkward as lovers in real life would be . how does your personal ranking system handle intelligent stars stuck in a heavily clich ? d drama ? in this case the whole audience knows what several of the key turning points have to be , and they're right . and how many credits do you deduct when a completely ridiculous and implausible ending comes totally out of left field for the sole purpose of mass audience manipulation . do you feel violated as a viewer ? in a movie that is as inviting and charming as it is annoying and infuriating , how to evaluate it is a tough call . sometimes you're captivated , and other times you're exasperated . will the good outweigh the bad for you ? maybe one of those personality tests would help . if you are in the hopelessly romantic category , you'll probably like the film's soap opera predictability and emotional shenanigans . on the other hand , if you' re more analytic , well ? you get the idea . teresa is a beautifully shy sort who bursts into girlish giggles when she feels unsure of herself . until this clich ? d scene , they have a romance that's heavy on cuddling . for one , dodge claims that his son's coffee is so terrible he shouldn't foist it off on any potential girlfriends . after a long romance that is quite sweet but meanders frequently , the movie comes to its maudlin conclusion . the result is a mixed bag of a movie ? just right for some viewers but perhaps too clich ? d for others . message in a bottle runs too long at 2 : 12 . the movie is rated for pg-13 for sexuality and a little profanity and would be fine for kids 11 and up . 
screenplay : christopher scott cherot . director : christopher scott cherot . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 92 minutes . like other recent indy success stories including the brothers mcmullen and clerks , hav plenty will win admirers for its comic charms and low-budget , can-do enthusiasm , even as detractors line up to fire pot-shots at its gross amateurishness and complete lack of visual style . think of it as puppy cinema : it's so easy to be won over by their cute , slobbery energy that you may overlook how much they need discipline to avoid making a mess time and time again . christopher scott cherot , the multi-hyphenate creator of hav plenty , definitely has the puppy thing down cold . not everyone could get away with a premise that sounds like a film-maker's ego-stroking fantasy . cherot , however , is so unassuming and self-effacing -- and so doncha-just-love-him puppy-cute -- that all the unsolicited romantic advances actually seem like they make him uncomfortable . though far from a polished performer , cherot has a natural screen presence , an eye for wry commentary and the rare ability in the 90s to sell a pratfall . simply put , it's easy to like him , even when the film's narrative gets a little rough around the edges . make that a _lot_ rough around the edges . cherot has a solid enough sense for how to put together a comic scene , but he hasn't got a clue yet how to unite them . hav plenty amounts to little more than a series of vignettes , ideas for character encounters lined up in a row until they add up to 90 minutes . the characters are little more than one-dimensional , occasionally even grotesque caricatures for the deadpan cherot to react to . there are even takes included where the actors clearly fumble their lines . in such a makeshift effort , the sly , slick performance of hill harper stands out as a hilarious delight . playing hav's fiance michael , a criminally insincere r&b star whose song titles involve such romantic analogies as comparing a woman to malt liquor in " love forty , " harper creates one genuinely brilliant scene and one great comic character . that scene and cherot's low-key appeal are enough to push hav plenty over the edge as an entertaining diversion . mostly , however , cherot will earn plaudits for his good intentions -- for making the film nearly as a one-man show , for creating a romantic comedy with smart , upscale african-american characters , etc . hav plenty ends with lee finding success as the " true story " of his relationship with havilland becomes his first film . if cherot wants to find success beyond hav plenty , he'll need to mature as an effective story-teller rather than just an effective joke-teller . a messy puppy may be cute , but all grown up he's just a mess . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
i gave the movie 2 stars . i liked it but could not recommend it . overall the show was a mess . you could fall asleep in parts it went so slow . you may remember gyllenhaal from all of the tv movies he has directed . perhaps you saw his awful paris trout on tv . the movie centered around winger's sexuality . she gave an absolutely wonderful performance . very realistic . i wish she had a better director . the other people in the movie were acceptable but nothing special . there is one scene in the movie that was more chilling than any horror show . best to close your eyes and hold your ears - it was frightening . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : december 6 , 1993 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
the epsteins are wonderful musicians and storytellers , openly explaining their music and talking about themselves with no pretensions or false modesty . they have no inhibitions about talking , in fact , it is hard to get them to keep quiet . but the richness of the lively music and the very natural and easy way the brothers play and communicate , makes this a heartfelt film , just like the music being played . you don't have to be jewish to like the music , as they proved to be popular in front of a mainly non-jewish audience in berlin , who couldn't get enough of that music . but when they played in their florida neighborhood to an elderly jewish audience , you couldn't help but notice how much more lively and even more appreciative their audience was . it also goes on a dull side trip to pinsk , a place that borders russia-poland , where their parents are from , but someplace they are unfamiliar with and because of that there was nothing worthwhile to see there . but , in all fairness to the director , aside from a few lapses in the film , he did capture the essence of the kletzmer music and what makes the epsteins so special . the brothers take pride in their craft and it shows in their musical pieces presented , as they bring out a heartfelt joy in their music . it was a fun film to watch , and it was informative to watch them practice and discuss the music , never taking themselves too seriously , but always serious about doing a good job . this film should be seen for the remakable music , the film itself is not that remarkable . 
cast : eddie murphy , jada pinkett , larry miller , dave chapelle , james coburn director : tom shadyac producers : brian grazer and russell simmons screenplay : david sheffield , barry w . blaustein , and steve oederkerk based on the movie written by jerry lewis and bill richmond cinematography : julio macat music : david newman u . s . distributor : universal pictures combining his own brand of high-energy comedy with that of ace ventura veterans tom shadyac and steve oederkerk , murphy is attempting to appeal to as wide an audience as possible . and , while the flatulence-joke lovers who flocked to dumb and dumber will doubtless be overwhelmed , not to mention doubled-over , by this movie , those hoping for more cerebral humor are destined to be disappointed . the nutty professor aims for guffaws at the lowest level -- anyone with a double-digit iq will get every joke . whether you laugh at them or not is often more of a matter of taste than a question of having a sense of humor . murphy is very funny , giving his most manic , inspired performance in years , and playing no less than seven different roles . too often , however , the script lets him down . i'll admit to laughing a number of times , but i couldn't help noticing all the squandered opportunities . the nutty professor should have been funnier than it is , but , by concentrating on bodily function humor , the film makers have limited murphy's effectiveness . this version of the nutty professor is loosely based on the 1963 jerry lewis comedy about a nerd inventing a potion that turns him into a lothario . jekyll and mr . it's interesting that in the last twelve months , we've seen three interpretations of this story . and , while the nutty professor isn't nearly as impressive as stephen frears' eerie , atmospheric mary reilly , it's infinitely more watchable than 1995's dr . jekyll and ms . curiously , for a tale known best for its horrific elements , none of these movies fits into the traditional horror genre -- two are comedies and the other is a drama . but , along with buddy's perfect physique comes a nasty , out-of-control personality . when it's not concentrating on members of sherman's family passing gas , belching , or threatening to sneeze all over the dinner table , some of the comedy is cute . for example , in a nightmare sequence where sherman imagines himself to be king kong , his goal when reaching through the window of a skyscraper isn't the girl , it's a roast turkey . among the other memorable sequences are an amusing takeoff on from here to eternity and the nicely-choreographed , climactic " battle " between sherman and buddy . there's an underlying message in the nutty professor about self- respect and accepting people as they are ( oddly , this is the same theme advanced by disney's the hunchback of notre dame ) . because murphy's performance as sherman makes us care about the character , it's easy to sympathize with his plight . unfortunately , this aspect of the story , which is the most touching , is skimmed over , presumably because the material is too heavy for a comedy . worse still , the presence of so many barbed fat jokes makes it easy to suspect the nutty professor of conflicted motives . the visual effects are top-rate , recalling jim carrey's the mask . it's a tour-de-force for the comic , and that almost makes the nutty professor worth seeing . alas , this movie is a little too interested in easy jokes to bother with having a heart . and , in the end , we're not sure whether we're supposed to be cheering for sherman or laughing at him . 
screenplay : bryan goluboff . director : scott kalvert . all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands . thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . it isn't just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised " featuring the music of . . . " no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles . your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole . the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner . as a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long " just say no " public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie . perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those " good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd " that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd . without a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack . director scott kalvert doesn't have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . mostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is . they also don't allow leonardo dicaprio's performance to be as strong as it could have been . for every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics . dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won't let character interaction define this story . at isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio's talents . far more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like . 
the yellow-colored y rays are tolerable , but the new green-colored z rays are pretty sinister . so what is the story about ? it's a murder mystery with romulus as a blend of the lead characters of shine , " columbo , " and the fisher king . jackson avoids all of the pitfalls of such a role , delivering a performance that makes romulus a complex character who deserves our sympathy and our understanding . director kasi lemmons , whose only other film was the acclaimed eve's bayou , has an acute sense of the visual . romulus's many surrealist dream sequences are particularly compelling , giving us an enhanced awareness of his pain . the caveman's valentine doesn't quite fit into any category . it's a fairly thin mystery but a heck of a character study . whatever it is , it keeps your eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end . without jackson to play the central role , the production would have been hopeless . it is rated r for language , some violence and sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
cast : chris farley , matthew perry , eugene levy , kevin dunn , david packer , lisa barbuscia director : christopher guest producer : denise di novi screenplay : mark nutter & tom wolfe & boyd hale cinematography : adam kimmel , kenneth macmillan music : jeffrey c . j . vanston u . s . distributor : warner brothers several days after having seen this movie , i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio . there's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script . this setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs . farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart doesn't seem to be in it . as a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man . i'm not a big fan of david spade , and i didn't like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together . as far as the supporting players go , none of them makes more than a fleeting impression . eugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla . frankly , it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman . although guest gets the costumes right , this nearly-inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution . the special effects , such as they are , are execrable . for an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they're obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle . even though farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes . while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric . farley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session .

a bottling plant can be a dangerous place if you're only a few inches tall . stuck in a milk bottle on its way down the assembly line to be filled , you are naturally consumed with terror . and it doesn't help if you're a little boy who hates milk anyway . borrowers are actually further divided into innies and outies , much like bellybuttons . innies are those borrowers that live inside your walls and under your floorboards . you've never seen them , of course , but when a sock seems to have disappeared from your drawer , it was probably a borrower who took it . among the film's many delights are gemma jackson's sets and marie france's costumes , both worthy of oscar consideration . the world as viewed from four inches high has never been more interesting and realistic , thanks to special effects that seem so natural . among the many little worlds created , the refrigerator is one of the best . why , to make climbing up easier . all of this is filmed by john fenner and trevor brooker with a rust colored cinematography that gives the picture a dreamy , nostalgic look . the screenplay by gavin scott and john kamps never makes the mistake so common today in kids' movies of setting the tone too dark . this is an imaginative environment where the borrowers creativity constantly saves the day . the movie teaches many a good lesson along the way . the serious father , who like all of the borrowers has a whimsically fun hairstyle , lectures his children on exactly what a borrower is . for those of you who liked the idea of tiny creatures living in walls battling a villain and an exterminator but hated mouse hunt , the borrowers is just picture for you . the ending , straight out of a brueghel painting , has a mass of borrowers so sweet that it may bring tears of joy to your eyes . " we're not creeps . and we're not pests . with the courage of a noble race , he explains that , " we may be small but heaven help anyone who thinks he might squish us . " it is rated pg for cartoonish violence and would be fine for kids four or five and up as well as adults with or without any kids . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , highly recommends the movie . his friend steven , age 9 , thought the movie was really funny . steven's twin john , obviously also 9 , thought it was a wonderful movie . 
there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do . i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda . something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob . deep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test . sure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait . . . excuse me , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion . as it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients . it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream . here , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j . o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic . writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously . deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes . case it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda . he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable . in anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive . he looks at another character . . . and winks . make no mistake , deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing . it's also gloomy , uninspired and not nearly enough fun . i don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies . you don't have to show me a fantastically impressive , massive beast with tentacles a-flailing . just show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
the much anticipated and highly praised crouching tiger , hidden dragon is the most overrated film of the year . although it has matrix-inspired moments that are truly magical , these are few and far between . a talky film with remarkably little to say , it features characters that are never fleshed out or worth caring about . kung fu fans will be probably be willing to wait through more long dry spots than death valley in order to watch the fighting . others may find themselves in the unusual position of frequently checking their watches in what , one assumes , is supposed to be an action picture . certainly , if the action sequences were removed , the rest of the comatose script would not be worth watching . in crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director ang lee ( sense and sensibility and the ice storm ) has come up with the least interesting film of his career , one that is , on the whole , not up even to his last effort , ride with the devil . needless to say , the others will want to get it back . the trailers show almost all of the good scenes from the movie . almost all of their movements do not occur naturally in nature . these sequences could have formed the basis for a wonderful motion picture , but , as soon as the action stops , the actors start to slowly , painfully slowly , drone on with some of the most lifeless dialog of the year . based on the trailers , i expected a magical motion picture . instead , i got a tedious one that is interrupted sporadically by interludes of brilliance . according to my watch , with which i become well acquainted during the screening , i believe that there are about 10 minutes of a great movie interspersed into an exceedingly dull one . see the trailers ; skip the movie . the film is in mandarin with english subtitles . it is rated pg-13 for martial arts violence and some sexuality and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up . i suspect , however , that most kids will be quite bored . 
" i'm going to shake the dust of this crummy little town off my feet . i'm going to see the world then i'm going to build things . " in the great frank capra's classic 1946 movie it's a wonderful life , george will never get to follow any of these dreams . no matter how bad he wants something , he is so selfless that he will give up everything to help his fellowman . none of this is ever to be for george , but by the show's conclusion george will come to realize what a wonderful life he has anyway . set mainly in a cold and snowy environment and with the show's conclusion at christmas eve , it's a wonderful life is a great film for the holidays . although sometimes bordering on the maudlin , it remains a beautifully uplifting story and a sweet little comedy as well . george's buildings and loan provides low cost loans that the townsfolk use to become home owners rather than renters . although potter is already " so rich he can never spend it all , " he wants more . james stewart's academy award nominated performance is what most people remember from the movie , but there is so much more . the lighting shines on her face in such a way that you will swear her face is lit from within . this scene has a wonderfully innocent sensuality to it without ever showing any flesh or using any provocative language . film makers today are incapable of anything this subtle when it comes to romance . it at this point in the story that george snaps , and what was a pleasant comedy is transformed into a great film . as clarence puts it , " you've been given a great gift , george . a chance to see what the world would be like without you . " mr . potter is richer than ever and the town poorer . the show ends in a miracle as true as the human spirit that the film embodies . it's a wonderful life runs 2 : 09 , and i loved every minute of it . it is not rated but would get a g . there is no sex , nudity , or profanity . the violence consists of one punch thrown in anger . " it was an okay movie , " said my son jeffrey , age 7 1/2 . " the only part i really liked was when they were kids . " he gave it a thumbs sideways . to enjoy the film kids probably need to be a little bit older than jeffrey . this simple story full of old fashioned , but nevertheless , relevant values is exceptional . i recommend it strongly to you and give it a full * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
what's the worst that could happen ? well , you could be watching freddie got fingered , the worst movie of the year and perhaps the decade , rather than what's the worst that could happen ? the latter , while it isn't particularly funny , may not even be the worst comedy of the week . his previous 2 films , drowning mona and the aptly named screwed , were perfectly awful . ) max feels no guilt since kevin has just robbed one of max's mansions . typical of the story's gags is kevin's inability to tell a lie without blinking . sam weisman ( the out-of-towners ) , who directs with ham handed obviousness , has lawrence exaggerate his blinking like a stage actor who needs to make sure that even those audience members way back in the cheap seats can still see his gestures . just in case the visuals aren't enough to have you in stitches , the dogs turn out to have a major flatulence problem . this juvenile comedy , with its recycled humor that seems always aimed squarely at kids around 12 or so , does have one truly funny scene . the television camera bleeps it all out , but the sign language translator relishes her big opportunity to ad lib with some obvious but nonetheless hilarious gestures . what's the worst that could happen ? it is rated pg-13 for language and sexual content and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up . my son jeffrey , age 12 , thought the picture was really funny and gave it * * * 1/2 . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
there is a single word which is quite conspicuous in its complete absence from the production notes for the adventures of pinocchio : " disney . " there are references to " the version most audiences find familiar , " and comments about the " watered-down " adaptation , but nowhere does anyone acknowledge that disney's 1940 animated classic presents a rather tough act to follow , perhaps as though they are wishing upon a star to erase that legacy . naturally , the film-makers have chosen to push the fact that this version is more " in the spirit " of the 1883 children's tale by carlo collodi than previous film versions , but while the adventures of pinocchio might be closer to the source material than that " version most audiences find familiar , " i suspect it won't be closer to the hearts of many viewers . it is a moderately diverting entertainment for children with little to offer for adults . there are a number of new twists to this telling of " pinocchio " which are actually quite interesting , chief among them the portrayal of pinocchio himself . still there is that legacy , and the adventures of pinocchio finds itself in the most trouble when it brings to mind the way similar sequences were handled by disney . all of the most familiar moments are here -- pinocchio's triumphant performance at the puppet show ; his fib-enhanced growing nose ; the transformation of lampwick ( corey carrier ) into a jackass ; the escape from inside the whale -- but the changes in those scenes are generally cases of trying to make them bigger rather than better . the transformation scene is particularly noteworthy in this respect , placing pinocchio , lampwick and a pair of other boys on what appears to be the indiana jones adventure , rocketing through caverns at maximum speed and volume . barron seems to have no idea what to do with him except consistently have him magnified or placed in annoying perspective shots , and his comments generally consist of limp attempts at anachronistic humor . on the one hand , i want to give barron credit for trying to unify the episodes of " pinocchio , " for eliminating the deus ex machina fairy and for underscoring the relationship between pinocchio and geppetto which seems to be an afterthought in disney's version . unfortunately , he doesn't really get where he wants to go , and he is too interested in keeping the kids happy with slapstick and the ever-popular dog urination gag to pay attention to the story which might mean something to adults . the adventures of pinocchio has enough visual spark to please young audiences , and a noble enough message to appease their parents , but it lacks the wit , warmth and emotional highs to erase the memory it is trying so hard to erase . this pinocchio may become a real boy , but he's not the real thing . 
frankly , i'm not entirely sure at what audience three wishes is aimed . with its wholesome , politically-correct story , it seems focused at the under-15 crowd . yet , considering the slow pace and relative dearth of action , adults might be the only ones with the patience to sit through these two hours . the result is a film that doesn't have a strong appeal for any age group . some viewers will undoubtedly be charmed by this mystical , whimsical motion picture , but it's doubtful there will be enough fans to save it from a quick box office death . hardly a traditional heroic image . as the soundtrack , which includes such tunes as " do you believe in magic ? " its message , which is all-but-shouted from the rooftops ( subtlety is not the film's strong suit ) , is that we should all stop yearning for what we can't have and " find happiness in whatever [we've] got . " just because there's a piece missing from the puzzle of the american dream doesn't mean that life can't be wonderful . this is a very traditional theme , and one that's probably a little too obvious for a sophisticated movie-going audience . of course , for those not impressed by the message , there's a heavy element of nostalgia to inhale . as relatively pleasant and undemanding as this film is , it runs a little too long , primarily because the setup takes the first half of the movie . three wishes appears to have undergone some fairly heavy editing to get it below the two hour mark , however , since several minor subplots are left dangling . the film opens and closes with brief contemporary ( 1995 ) scenes that might have better underscored the primary theme had they been given a greater portion of the running time . character development is also on the weak side . basically , they're just well-acted stereotypes with a few interesting lines of dialogue . the supporting characters fare far worse--there isn't an interesting one in the whole lot . darker than capra , yet somewhat reminiscent of ( albeit inferior to ) classics like it's a wonderful life , three wishes has a good heart , effective direction by martha coolidge ( rambling rose ) , and solid acting -- yet the occasional meandering of the script doesn't allow the movie to be as engaging or enchanting as it ought to be . three wishes is all about the supernatural , and , considering the nearly impossible-to-market nature of the subject matter , it's going to take a major miracle for more than a handful of people to see this film in theaters before its quick transfer to video . 
as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ? also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films . in a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings . in shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls . suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them . an opening prologue in shall we dance ? goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety . it's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle . plays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities . sugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps . it's a delicate performance with a huge heart . shall we dance ? is a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit . suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution . it is here that shall we dance ? feels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis . that's the real joy of dance shall we dance ? conveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
date released : varies running length : 1 : 33 rated : nc-17 ( graphic violence , language , nudity , rape ) starring : remy belvaux , benoit poelvoorde , andre bonzei director : remy belvaux producers : belvaux , poelvoorde , and bonzei screenplay : belvaux , poelvoorde , bonzei , and vincent tavier released by roxie releasing french with english subtitles as a short , this could have been a brilliant , blistering satire on society's views of violence and how it relates to movies . however , man bites dog is a full-length feature and , as such , spends a little too much time with its subject . thirty minutes , or even forty-five , would have been a perfect length , but by the end of the third half-hour , certain elements of this movie ( namely ben's endless philosophizing ) have grown tired . the violence has lost its edge and the movie has begun to meander . nevertheless , despite the possibly-excessive length , there is still a lot to praise in this obscure effort by a trio of previously-unknown belgian film makers . they have taken violence in the cinema to its ultimate limit and created an always-irreverent , often darkly funny look at killers and victims . every moment of this film is shot documentary-style in grainy black-and-white . this pseudo-realism , complete with choppy editing and unsteady , hand-held camera shots , gives an eerie air of legitimacy to man bites dog . the film makers are remy and andre , and the killer is benoit . benoit possesses an especially interesting personae . heartless as a killer , he's actually a fun guy to be around most of the time . he's smart and thoughtful , often giving lengthy discourses on various aspects of life and death . at first , it's just little things like shining a light in a certain spot , but it doesn't take long before they're actually joining in . at one time or another , comparisons have been made between this film and a couple of other recent , gut-wrenching productions--henry : portrait of a serial killer and reservoir dogs . from my point-of-view , while there are superficial similarities between these pictures and man bites dog , the basic thrust is radically different . reservoir dogs and henry are both serious movies . man bites dog approaches itself and its subject with tongue planted firmly in cheek . one of the most hilarious moments in the film comes when ben has a shoot-out with another killer . dark , twisted humor like this characterizes man bites dog . the limited budget of the film shows , but in a way that adds to the genuine feel of what we're seeing . the plot has a couple of twists that allow us to see various emotions from all of the principals of man bites dog . nevertheless , through the entire movie , the only character to be effectively developed is that of the killer , ben . obviously not a movie for everyone , man bites dog boasts graphic displays of murder and rape . there's very little of the human body--inside or out--that isn't shown at one time or another during the course of this movie . nevertheless , if you do venture to see man bites dog , you would have to be made out of stone to miss the visceral , sardonic impact of a highly-unusual film . 
jekyll and mr . there's also a none-too-subtle message about the dangers of letting the advancements of science outstrip corresponding ethics . moreau is a tale of great substance ; as re-invented by director john frankenheimer ( the manchurian candidate ) , it's disappointingly shallow and pointless . this is , in fact , the third time the h . g . wells story has been brought to the screen . moreau opened in theaters . arguably better than the original , this uses state-of-the-art makeup to augment an adventure that still has time to consider the philosophical implications of its subject matter . and , while it might have been possible to argue the merits of this version of the island of dr . moreau if it had offered something more than the others , the sad truth is that it offers much less . for , while the creatures look better than in even the 1977 version , the heart and soul of the story have been gutted , leaving behind a hollow , chaotic nightmare . somewhere under the debris left by a script credited to four screenwriters lie the remnants of wells' story , but the original tale is distorted and diluted not only by the need to " modernize " it , but the desire to emphasize visual effects and pyrotechnics over drama . almost immediately , edward becomes aware that some very strange things are taking place there . steeped in an atmosphere that grows more ominous and eerie with each scene , the first half hour promises far more than what the rest of the production delivers . the film's middle portion , while watchable , makes us aware that the script wasn't written for thinking viewers . it's during the concluding half hour , however , that the movie's house-of-cards storyline collapses . nothing much makes sense , and the climax seems to exist solely as an opportunity to show off a few reasonably impressive explosions . the acting varies from bad to awful . he's only on screen for about fifteen minutes , and , while there , his amazing girth is far more likely to capture our attention than his acting . to be fair , fairuza balk ( gas food lodging ) does a credible job of mixing kittenish and human qualities , but , although she creates the only sympathetic character in the entire film , she is underused . insultingly , frankenheimer concludes the movie with a short sermon about the fine line that separates man from beast . if the director actually wanted to get this point across , he should have worked it into the film rather than tacking it on as an afterthought . it is , after all , an integral aspect of the source material . that it has been so thoroughly excised from the main plot isn't the island of dr . moreau's only problem , but it's symptomatic of the flawed mindset that went into planning this occasionally incoherent and ultimately disappointing motion picture . 
( many will write this off as a plot device , but since i have one close relative whose family got by with a similar ruse in the great depression , i could identify with their plight . ) the abramowitzs live in squat , ugly , stucco boxes with ironic names like the " casa bella " apartments . it would have been easier to have had murray be unemployed , but the smart script gives murray a job -- user car salesmen -- without the skills to make much money from it . his only daughter , vivian , is the film's central character . " what seems to be the problem ? " she's sure that they are so large that people will laugh at her so breast reduction surgery might be just the answer . vivian , in a delicate , funny , and slightly erotic scene , finds even better uses for the vibrator when rita isn't there . the comedy rarely subsides , and yet the picture is more touching than funny . director jenkins has a deft touch in blending in plenty of humor to keep us interested while she weaves a poignant tale of a struggling family who manage to always keep their heads up and their bags packed . it is rated r for sex , nudity , profanity and drug content , and would be fine for older teenagers . 
watch radha mitchell long enough , and i'll bet you'll start seeing a young mariel hemingway . watch high art long enough , and i'll bet you'll start seeing a heroin-chic spin on personal best . the " lesbian awakening " genre may hardly rival the mis-matched buddy comedy in sheer weight of numbers , but the conventions are just as conventional in their own way : wide-eyed naif , experienced older woman , tentative first steps , heartfelt discusson over what the wide-eyed naif really wants , oppressive earnestness . been there , done that , seen it all . there's one thing in high art , however , that i can virtually guarantee you haven't seen before : ally sheedy as a serious actress . sheedy's performance alone is nearly enough to recommend high art , and you can color me as stunned as anyone that you're reading those words . sheedy inhabits the character -- a woman who wants to return to her art but doesn't know if her past will permit it -- with an intensity only autobiographical subtext can provide sometimes . the impish grin of the teen star of wargames and the breakfast club now nestles in the lines of a haggard , drawn , aged-beyond-her-years face ; you can see the spark under there somewhere , ready for an opportunity to burst out . sadly , the rest of lisa cholodenko's script -- an inexplicable award-winner at sundance -- strands sheedy's performance in a sea of cliches and muddled relationships . it also makes syd's sexual awakening the center of the story , then fails to develop the character with anything near the necessary depth . everything about high art tells us we should understand syd's ambition , her emptiness , her readiness to be part of lucy's wasteland milieu , but cholodenko assumes too much and shows too little . like too many screenwriters , cholodenko assumes that situation will carry the story , leaving us with characters whose relationsihps feel like plot devices . though the seedy art-clique atmosphere adds a different dynamic , high art is still a formulaic film with little dramatic urgency . the urgency that does emerge comes entirely from ally sheedy , whose own awakening provides a far more fascinating story than the one cholodenko wrote . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
i saw the closet thing to heaven at san jose's cinequest film festival . the picture has a cute set up , but little else to recommend the film . the writer borrows heavily from the short cuts style of plot . only his bow tie has any color . there are many other similar , failed attempts at humor . i rarely laughed . the acting is amateurish . only the man in the white hat shows any promise as a actor . the closest thing to heaven runs 1 : 38 . it is not rated but would get an r for the drug usage and the profanity . the show takes risks in order to be funny , but the jokes do not work . i cannot recommend the picture , and i give it just * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : february 1 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
much ado about nothing is another shakespearean film from that shakespearean master kenneth branagh . there is no one today who can do shakespeare like branagh , see , for example , his henry v , which was number one on my list the year it was released . in much ado about nothing , he wrote the screen adaptation as well as did the direction . i will assume that most of you know the plot in much ado about nothing from school so i will not repeat in detail here . the movie is uneven , but the range is from good to outstanding . they have so much energy , it makes you feel alive and glad to be on any planet they inhabit . they are the older lovers in the show , but by far and away the most interesting . the younger lovers' acting abilities are okay at best . robert sean leonard's acting is quite unsure in the early scenes , but he warms up a bit to the part as the movie builds steam . on the whole , i found their romance a disappointment . i still remember romeo and juliet ( 1969 ) so i know how great it can be . although denzel washington is in the film , his heart and passion seem to be somewhere else . he is fine in his role , but nothing special . the only serious problem in the casting is michael keaton . as an actor , when he is good , he is very very good ( see for example clean and sober ) , and when he is bad ( don't see one good cop ) , he is awful . i have not seen such overacting in a long time as his acting in much ado about nothing . the technical aspects of the movie are outstanding . the cinematography by roger lanser and the sets by tim harvey are lush and gorgeous . if you feel in the mood for a movie not costing something approaching the national debt to produce , if you actually enjoy humans in your movies ( no , i am not dinophobic , but there is more to life than jurassic park ) , if you especially like humans who can talk and have something to say at the same time , if you like screens smaller than candlestick park , then go to your local art house and see much ado about nothing . much ado about nothing runs 1 : 51 . it is correctly rated pg-13 and would be fine for any kid old enough to appreciate the bard . i recommend the show to you and give it * * * . i look forward with great anticipation to branagh's next shakespeare piece , and the one after that , and the one that . . . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : june 25 , 1993 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
this is not necessarily good in that the major suffering of the film is that it has play stamped all over it . plays are in-person experiences that happen in intimate settings . films take place on a much larger scale . this causes the wit and humor of the play to come across all too often as the pedantic ramblings and sermons of a couple of old men . the beauty of the language does come through , but the net effect of the movie is to make the viewers wish they had gone to the play instead . " lies , not lies -- alternatives . sometimes the truth doesn't quite fit , " argues nat . there are some interesting images in the picture . the long scenes of banter in the park undoubtedly worked well in the play . in the film , they are too long and preachy . more lively editing or camerawork would have helped . i find that matthau's acting frequently annoys me , but in this film i loved his work and that davis's . i empathized with them both . two convincing performances . less effective is the supporting cast . there is nothing wrong with their performances , but they provide little more than window dressing in this two person play . boyd gaines plays a jogging character named danforth who does have a single good line : " truth is i hate running . being immortal takes too much time . " if you like to watch for goofs , you can see the boom appear quite clearly twice in the famous " i'm not rappaport " joke sequence between nat and midge . most movie goers get entertainment , but i got a talky play masquerading as a movie . if you can get past the stilted filming , the film has a message worth hearing . i'm not rappaport runs too long at 2 : 15 because the play was not effectively adapted into a movie . it is rated pg-13 for dope smoking among the geriatric set . there is a little profanity and some violence , but no sex or nudity . the film's attitude about drugs makes me suggest that the film be seen only by kids who are over twelve . i found the filming frustrating , but i liked most of what the movie had to say so i am recommending it and giving it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
what we get here , however , is often unintentionally closer to monty python and the holy grail's silliness than to excalibur's melodramatic grandeur . bad acting , dumb dialogue , and confusing cinematography abound , creating one of the most shoddy camelot stories to date . what makes first knight seem even worse is that it's up against the vastly superior braveheart , a romantic adventure in very much the same vein , although formed from an entirely different mould . in first knight , we're introduced to king arthur of camelot ( sean connery ) , his intended bride guinevere ( julia ormond ) , and the valiant sir lancelot ( richard gere ) , who apparently is hot for the queen-to-be ( or so the script tells us -- you couldn't tell by gere's acting ) . add to this an idiotic hollywood ending , and first knight turns out to be a mess of the first order . too bad he isn't given more to do than stand around looking regal . then there's richard gere , terribly miscast as lancelot . in fact , it's hard to imagine a less likely figure in the part of this legendary hero , uttering such pretentious lines as " i never believed in anything before , but now i believe in camelot . " at least he spares us an attempt at a bogus british accent . there are the requisite battle sequences which feature huge armies clashing on an open field . filmed with all the coherence of an mtv video , these are prime examples of how not to shoot this sort of scene . maybe zucker should have consulted mel gibson before embarking on this project . the sustained tension of braveheart's battles is in marked contrast to the boredom generated by first knight's . when all is said and done , there's still at least one amazing thing about first knight : after being kidnapped , dragged through a forest , imprisoned , rescued , and nearly drowned , guinevere's lipstick is perfectly intact . that this bit of minutia sticks out so clearly speaks volumes about the dullness of this supposed adventure film . 
academy award winning actor kevin spacey is easily one of the most interesting actors working in film today . never to be taken for granted , he brings a cool unpredictability to any part he plays . negotiator his cherubic face masks an intelligence and intensity that makes his character completely captivating . it's never clear what his next move will be . " you have no idea what i am capable of . " no kidding . director f . gary gray's taut thriller starts with a formulaic approach , but soon takes some major side turns . from beginning to end , the well-executed film has the audience on the edge of their seats . although there are some bad plot choices , as when one character's bravado turns almost suicidal , the story is a well-developed and intelligent mystery about police corruption . with plenty of action to keep the adrenaline pumping but not so much as to overwhelm the psychological drama at the heart of the story , the movie strikes just the right balance . the brightly written script by james demonaco and kevin fox mixes in just enough humor without transforming the tone of the picture . it assumes the audience has enough intelligence to see some obvious ruses even before most of the characters in the drama realize what is happening . j . t . walsh , who specialized in portraying characters with shady reputations , is perfect for the part . as good as jackson is as the story's central character , spacey is even better . chris and danny go into a beautifully scripted series of negotiations . danny is the funniest , but chris is the most surprising . suffice it to say that you wouldn't want to play cards with either of them . gives a fast-paced energy to the picture's look . using fast moving close-ups , slow motion , and a few cuts to black and white , he gives the movie a gritty intimacy . the engrossing movie has a strong supporting cast that includes david morse , ron rifkin , and john spencer among others . the test of a mystery and an action thriller is how well the writers can bring the story to a conclusion . the negotiator has some well thought through ending surprises that are completely plausible and fascinating to watch unfold . if a film has kevin spacey in it , you will not be disappointed . even if spacey should find his way into a bad movie , his part will be well worth the negotiator runs a little too long at 2 : 15 . it is rated r for violence and profanity and would be fine for most teenagers . 
just like the formula script of free willy 3 : the rescue , she does not think ahead . john mattson , the writer of free willy 2 : the adventure home , again connects the dots to give us basically the same movie plus one . randolph , played by august schellenberg , is again the most animated of the characters . among the best and worst parts of the plot are the villains . in easily the most refreshing part of the picture , the film explores briefly the other side of an environmental issue . the problem with this approach is that it becomes hard to hate a bad guy who seems trapped in his profession and who is such a good father . without an adequate villain , the show lacks much credible tension . tv director sam pillsbury's film feels like a direct-to-video production , which is how the inevitable free willy 4 should be marketed . as a two dollar rental that only the kids watch , the movie becomes a more palatable proposition . within the confines of a theater , pillsbury's lethargic pacing and the script's paucity of ideas become all too apparent . the dialog is full of the platitudes one might find in a substandard third grade reader . " they don't feel . the only reason to see the show are the frolicking whale sequences , framed nicely by the rugged mountains of the pacific northwest coast . the most remarkable scenes are those shot underwater , featuring close-ups of the people and the whales looking eye-to-eye . still , a half hour short film of just these scenes would have been much preferable to a feature length movie padded with the recycled material from the last two movies in the series . if your kids want to see this film , try to talk up the advantages of waiting for it to come out on video . maybe by then they will have forgotten , and you can suggest some much better show at the video rental store instead . the scene where willy gets shot with a spear may be too much for kids under 6 , but for older ones the show would be fine . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought the film was great but complained that all the free willy pictures have the same story . my sentiments exactly . i give thumbs down to this lame rehash and award it * 1/2 for at least having the courage to try to tell two sides of an environmental issue . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
without any of the refinements he has shown in some of his latter films , jim carrey , as ace ventura , keeps the humor in this one insufferably crude . never has a film been less in need of a sequel than this one , but after making over a hundred million dollars in 1994 , there has , regrettably , already been one sequel . in need of a better script than the one by jack bernstein , carrey , and the director , tom shadyac , carrey struts his stuff without restraint . carrey is an undeniable comedic genius but one in need of control . as proof of how good carrey can be , consider his relatively more restrained performances in liar , liar and the mask . the rest of the movie is the same , ad nauseam . the script is devoid of ideas , and the movie plays as if it were one long ad lib routine by carrey . she and all of the other actors provide little more than a backdrop for carrey's showing off . ace ventura has one memorable scene -- the ending credits , which bring blessed relief . it is rated pg-13 for profanity , nudity , and crude sexual humor . the movie would be acceptable for most kids ten and up . my son jeffrey , age 8 1/2 , said he really liked it and especially thought ace was funny . he volunteered that he believed the movie should be for kids 10 and up because of the sex stuff in it . 
ask the typical moviegoer about a film , and what you will be told about are the stars and the plot . with few exceptions , the director is never mentioned . and the writers are totally ignored . excess baggage can serve as an object lesson in the importance of an intelligent script and a director with a sense of vision . for stars the picture was to have the talented alicia silverstone and christopher walken , and the setup for the story showed great promise . the resulting film , however , leaves much to be desired . screenwriters max d . adams , dick clement and ian la frenais fashion the outline of their characters but never bother to fill them in . the dialog is as sparse as it is meaningless , making the movie seem like a partially finished body of work that was rushed into production before it was completed . director marco brambilla , whose only other film was demolition man , crafts a story without context or compass . the film appears to be a dark comedy , but dark comedies have impressive atmospherics and are , shall we say , funny . this remarkably humorless movie has a laugh count of one -- an unprintable line of silverstone's that occurs 45 minutes into the film . jean-yves escoffier's pedestrian cinematography has no discernible look to it , rendering it as uninviting as the soliloquies of the actors . someone to guide me through life . silverstone brings nothing to the role and rarely rises above her poorly written part . her character , like all of the characters in the story , is unsympathetically drawn . the movie is populated by people who are more walking enigmas than flesh-and-blood human beings . if an unexpected tornado had killed all of the characters , none of them would have been worth mourning . this sounds better than it is due to the director's inability to stage compelling scenes . rarely is what they say worth hearing , so perhaps the paucity of lines is a blessing in disguise . benicio del toro , as the thief , sleepwalks through most of the picture , waking periodically to mumble some incomprehensible lines . he will speak the lines written , but he will not show one scintilla of emotion . when christopher walken shows up as emily's uncle ray , the film briefly looks promising again , since walken is the master of the creepy . the director manages to confuse walken too . the only differences is that he looks incredibly sad . you would be too if you were stuck in this movie . when the inevitable conclusion finally comes , it is not clear what the director of this sleep-inducing picture had intended to accomplish . his slightly mean-spirited film wasn't funny , gave no message and touched no emotional nerves . i left as confused as the actors . excess baggage runs 1 : 41 . it is rated pg-13 for violence , drinking , and sexual dialog . the film would be fine for teenagers and those a bit younger . i do not recommend the picture , and i give it a generous * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
screenplay : andrew w . marlowe . director : wolfgang petersen . the phenomenally popular presidency of ronald reagan , if nothing else , gave us a solid sense of what the american people really want in a chief executive . if that phrase doesn't describe harrison ford among all a-list hollywood stars , i don't know whom it does describe . that kind of man isn't just the perfect president -- he's also the perfect action hero . air force one is an extraordinarily effective thriller by any standard , but it's even better with ford on board . wolfgang petersen's direction combines the claustrophobia of das boot with the cat-and-mouse dynamic of in the line of fire , then throws in a few stomach-churning dogfights and mid-air escape attempts just for seasoning . there hasn't been a more assured piece of technical film-making in theaters this year , nor a more riveting action spectacle . ford , however , moves air force one from the realm of the mere thrill ride to something more potent . it is the " honor " part of that equation which may raise a few hackles over the rah-rah patriot games of air force one . still , andrew w . marlowe's script never feels jingo all the way . lecture me on the articles of war " ) . in fact , every performer takes chances which make air force one more than a simple crowd-pleaser . the gutsiest choices may be those made by glenn close , playing vice-president kathryn bennett . in a more pandering film , bennett would have been the take-charge woman in a room full of ineffectual men . not that anyone could blame her . part of what makes air force one so satisfying -- and , at times , so wryly amusing -- is that it places president marshall squarely in the real world of 1990s american political consciousness . the unswerving devotion , the candlelight vigils and the tremendous popularity all make perfect sense as the reactions of cynics in the presence of true greatness . it's easy to get caught up in the thrills of air force one , not just because it is so well-constructed , but because we're watching a national fantasy . there's only one thing missing from the finale of air force one : harrison ford should step onto the tarmac at dulles , tip his hat to the assembled throng , sweep the first lady up onto his trusty horse , and ride into the sunset . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
demian lichtenstein's 3000 miles to graceland isn't the movie that you've seen in the trailers , which is a shame . that movie looked like a lot of fun . we know this because the first 20 minutes or so follow this outline . but after that , in a hail of thousands and thousands of bullets , the picture turns into another gorefest that would be an nc-17 candidate if the mpaa hadn't long ago fallen asleep at the wheel . after a promising beginning , the guys shed their costumes and the movie turns into a bad spaghetti western -- one too cheesy for clint to have anything to do with . get it ? well enjoy it , since that's about as funny as 3000 miles to graceland ever gets . the busy script by richard recco and demian lichtenstein has more holes than the proverbial swiss cheese . the script attempts to fill all of the holes with lots of shoot-'em-ups . and , when he can't think of anything else to do , which is often , the director points the camera at the clouds , which the editor speeds up . don't knock it . it keeps you awake . barely . among the hollywood actors to drop by for parts is jon lovitz -- you know , the guy who invented the yellow pages . " it's a joke , " his character tells murphy after one of his failed attempts at humor . you'll need to be reminded of that often in this comedy , which is as flat as the nevada desert where it is set . take my advice and don't stay to watch the music video during the closing credits . it will make you sad for it shows what the disappointing 3000 miles to graceland could have been -- irreverently funny rather than mean-spiritedly tedious . it is rated r for strong violence , sexuality and language and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
a poor imitation of lubitsch's classic romance/comedy trouble in paradise . even though it is terribly outdated for modern audiences , it was seen as the height of fashion at its time as for style and dress . it was a witty depression eye-pleaser for american audiences who liked to watch the rich in action , especially seeing them get robbed of their jewels . 
m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing . the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . which explains the film's mythic theme . . . as the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . robert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first " mission , " who is noted for doing " chinatown " -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . if i was only entertained by this . . . i could have lived with it . but this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . in any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into . 
the quirky duo who hung around in the background of kevin smith's 1994 debut feature , clerks , have returned to the screen for the followup , mallrats , the middle picture of the so-called " new jersey trilogy . " in many ways , this new movie is a less original , not-as-funny , full color redressing of clerks . despite a broad range of effective comedy and a decent laugh-per-minute ratio , mallrats is likely to be a moderate disappointment for anyone who guffawed their way through the previous film . their role here is a little more prominent than in their previous outing , and about half of mallrats' best humor is centered around them . they're involved in quite a bit of road runner/wylie coyote slapstick which , while obviously juvenile , is still hilarious . the script for mallrats is rather disjointed and episodic . although smith's knack for insightful comic dialogue is much in evidence , many of the lines aren't the equal of those in clerks for cleverness or humor . and , the less funny the dialogue is , the more stilted and unnatural it seems . there are several painfully awkward " dead spots " in mallrats where nothing works--not the dialogue , the acting , or the direction . pop references abound with as much regularity as the jokes ( sometimes they are the jokes ) . these range from nods to classic movies ( sundance in butch cassidy and the sundance kid ) , star wars , and '80s teen farces ( such as those directed by john hughes ) to comic book characters , " the dating game " , and ( inevitably , given shannen doherty's presence ) a certain current tv show with a zip code in the title . smith is aware that there is a niche audience for mallrats--the under-30 crowd . as a result , the film plays almost exclusively to this group , and comes across as a grungy , male version of clueless . there is such a thing as the " sophomore jinx " for film makers . smith freely admits that he toned down the script and broadened the comedy in a quest for wider appeal , and allows that mallrats is a far less " cerebral " film than clerks . time , of course , will tell , but as long as jay and silent bob are around , future efforts can't be all that bad--or , for that matter , all that deep . 
steve martin is at it again remaking classic stories in new , fresh , and wonderful ways . his best still is " cyrano de bergerac " , which he called roxanne but which i wish he had called it simply cyrano . this time it is " silas marner " and he titles this one a simple twist of fate , but silas would have been my choice . overall , the original silas marner is a morose story , but with happy parts . martin's version is much more upbeat . even the villains are not that awful . this is a wonderful and realistic movie yet with a fairy tale feel to it at times . you can especially see this in the mystical and symbolic balloon episode . the high points of the movie are the ingenuity of the script and martin's acting . the rest of the characters , especially catherine o'hara as april simon , were all good . the major problem in the show was the miscasting and misdirecting of the villains . baldwin , who was a character you should have really hated , played him way too soft . a simple twist of fate is a very positive and life affirming movie . i heartily recommend it to everyone . it is rated pg-13 , but i thought of it more as a pg show . no profanity that i can remember nor any violence . personally , i would take any kid over say 9 . the movie runs 1 : 41 . i give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : september 2 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
that's the most likely question after seeing tar ? rin's x . the most frequent question of those who haven't seen it is about the title . the short answer is that the film has nothing to do with pornography and that it is rated r , not x . telling an apocalyptic story with stirring , visual panache , this japanese animated movie ( anime ) dazzles us with its depressing images and dramatic music . if blade runner were remade into an animated feature by the japanese , this is probably how it would look . from what i was able to piece together it seems to involve the dragons of the heavens , who come from the 7 stars that make up the big dipper , the dragons of the earth and the tokyo power grid . i am not making this up . periodically the narrator stops for a minute and introduces another batch of characters along with their history . imagine that you have never heard of christianity and that you are introduced to it by a single animated movie that covers all the books of the bible . this describes the experience of watching x , which rin directs with a mixmaster approach . the film's images are stunning , but , boy , are they ever violent . the end of the world isn't pretty . as i watched the movie , unable to figure much of it out , i began to wonder why various figures are drawn the way they are . most of them have dime-sized mouths , whereas most of the men have full-sized ones . is this the way that the women keep so fashionably skinny ? in a movie that is deadly serious , the stilted dialog provides unexpected sources of mirth . ( " you're handling the situation so stylishly , i thought it would be unaesthetic to interfere . " ) although one could write this off to bad translations , i'm not buying it . princess mononoke had no such problem , and the ridiculousness of the script for x permeates every scene . if you want to enjoy more than just x's stunning look , perhaps reading the book would help . i can't say . what i do know is that even with my usual copious notes taken during the film , i still couldn't figure it out . the saving grace is that x never made me care that i found it indecipherable . x is dubbed in english and is rated r for violence , gore and some nudity . it would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
symbols are supposed to be subtle , but rozema is intent upon bludgeoning the audience with them . in addition to the film's most pervasive symbol--a dead , refrigerated dog , there are trapeze artists , hang-gliders , and allusions to cupid and psyche . all have at least one secondary meaning . unfortunately , rozema's script doesn't do justice to these potentially charged issues , preferring cliches and shallow dialogue to something more challenging and compelling . as is too often the case , camille's religious convictions are shown to be a negative influence while petra's open sensuality is positive . there's no middle ground here ; it's all black-and-white . likewise , camille's relationship with martin is pretty much a hollow sham . there's no depth to when night is falling ; the script is too determined to categorize and compartmentalize everything . pascale bussieres is appealing as camille , doing her best to breathe life into a shallowly-drawn personae . the supporting cast is less impressive , however . rachel crawford , despite being pleasant and perky , hampers the film with her unpolished acting technique . and don mckellar , who recently appeared in atom egoyan's exotica , is annoying in the largely- superfluous role of the circus organizer . when night is falling is a beautifully-filmed motion picture , but even the most glorious cinematography can't eclipse the story's flaws . instead of plowing new ground , rozema churns up soil that has long since been exhausted . all that's left are stock characters and situations , contrived emotional conflicts , and a slightly preachy narrative style . like a postcard , when night is falling is pretty to look at but devoid of significant content . 
this just in : the sincere romantic drama is not extinct . make no mistake , it's on the endangered species list ; in this oh-so-ironic era , sincerity sightings have been akin to those blurry shots of the loch ness monster and hubcap-like flying saucers . you don't expect mainstream movies to deliver romantic stories that seem grounded in genuine feelings , and you certainly don't expect it from don roos , who wrote and directed the attitude-laden the opposite of sex . nevertheless , here comes bounce offering that rarest of y2k big-screen commodities : an adult relationship with some real emotion . it starts out , however , like a typical high-concept trifle . the surprise is that the relationship never feels like a wacky contrivance . roos is a smart writer with a nose for full characterizations , and the story development as a whole rarely feels manipulated for the convenience of the plot ( see below for notable exception ) . he steps back as a director from some of the most potentially exploitative moments , and injects his sharp wit in places where it works organically ( particularly in the person of johnny galecki as buddy's assistant ) . though it's a romance with some humor , it never ignores the basic sadness in both buddy and abby's lives that gives resonance to their connection . though it's a romance with tragic elements , it never wallows in the tragedy so much that it turns into melodrama . bounce could have been a true gem of a film if the leads had been more evenly matched as actors . gwyneth paltrow is one of those performers who appears doomed to be scorned and underappreciated for her talent as long as she is still young and attractive , but let's get this straight : she's a damned good actress . in bounce , she's once again wonderful , capturing abby's strength and vulnerability . affleck , on the other hand , still has some growing to do as an actor . he's not a bad actor , but he still carries himself on screen primarily with a swagger , even when he's supposed to be emotionally wounded . buddy the charming cad is a role affleck can make appealing in his sleep . not only does it once again place affleck in the unfortunate position of getting all mega-serious on us , it's also the only time bounce starts to feel like something that could only happen in a movie . there's nothing inherently wrong with romantic dramas that take on that an affair to remember-style sense of heightened tragedy . it's just so unusual when a film gives you the opportunity to explore romantic complications more simply . bounce makes it's share of mistakes , but it's always clear that its heart is in the right place . how refreshing to spend time with a film willing to show you its heart at all . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
once , not that many years ago , it was difficult to find an intelligent gay/lesbian love story . now , with features like go fish and jeffrey reaching multiplex screens , the field is no longer as barren . nevertheless , there's still quite a bit of fertile ground worth exploring . in its depiction of an unlikely romance , late bloomers is touching and sensitive . the two principal characters are nicely-developed , and gretchen dyer's script doesn't condescend to either . every anti-gay cliche is used , and the story becomes oppressively melodramatic . this , and other similar moments , weaken late bloomers' impact . connie nelson and dee hennigan are solid in the lead roles , but gary carter is ineffective as ron , and lisa peterson gives an uneven performance . director julia dyer goes for a tone that's part hard- hitting drama and part erotic fairy tale . her results are mixed -- sometimes the two compliment each other , but there are also moments when they're at cross purposes . ultimately , late bloomers is better-written than many lesbian romances ( such as , for example , claire of the moon or devotion ) , but it still falls into enough melodramatic traps to keep it from rising into the genre's upper echelon . 
the beach , directed by danny boyle ( trainspotting ) , is an entertaining , but not especially original , adventure yarn . the film works as a star vehicle for leonardo dicaprio , but the rest of the casting is singularly uninspired . the easy to cast role of the alluringly gorgeous french woman , for example , is given to virginie ledoyen , who looks and acts particularly bland . still , as a travelogue from hell , the picture does have its charms . even at its most enjoyable , the film loses a certain amount of credibility from the sense of d ? j ? vu that it evokes . if it were better than some of the movies that it imitates , this might not be a problem , but there isn't a scene which isn't stronger in the original . most people would beat a hasty retreat at this point , but not our hedonists . would you be willing to risk your life to get to it ? now , be honest , don't you think you can guess the rest of the movie ? well , you can . think that the commune's peaceful coexistence with the dope growers will last ? see , you could have written the screenplay . some of boyle's staging choices are particularly surprising . and the star is french no less . richard's rich narration is one of the film's chief allures along with its gorgeous scenery and dreamy music . " i found that love , like grief , tends to fade away and be replaced by something more exciting , " he remarks at the start of his descent into madness . sal certainly doesn't want anything to spoil her clan's fun . she'll do whatever it takes to keep the good times rolling . the movie , which does have its pleasures , could have been so much better if they hadn't blown their bankroll on dicaprio . his performance is good , but not strong enough to carry the entire picture . it is rated r for strong violence , some strong sexuality , language and drug content . it would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
nobody's fool is about as sublime a motion picture as is likely to come out of hollywood . with a structure that contravenes the norm , this film concentrates on character first , letting the plot fall naturally into place . situations are forced on neither the film's inhabitants nor on those in the audience . it's rare to sit through a drama and not feel manipulated , but the feelings generated by robert benton's movie are entirely natural , and likely to bring a smile to the heart . nobody's fool is as much about regrets as about choices made ; as much about the road not taken as the one traveled . for those seeking a film with an unforgettable central character , nobodys fool is not to be missed . not only does it offer the best in easygoing , unconfrontational drama , but the story is told with a sense of wry , intelligent humor . in fact , the movie is so perfectly attuned to its audience that it can display melanie griffith's breasts without the moment's self-consciousness that so often accompanies nudity in american motion pictures . speaking of griffith , this is the best acting she has done in a long time . after a string of lackluster comedies ( the last one of which was milk money ) and ineffective thrillers ( shining through , a stranger among us ) , nobody's fool offers a role for which she is suited . also holding his own is bruce willis , here in his second consecutive solid performance ( on the heels of pulp fiction ) . jessica tandy , to whom the film is dedicated , is as effective as ever . of course , no one can quite match newman , who shows a chameleon-like ability to shed his star image and don a most atypical personality . this is the sort of part normally associated with a character actor of albert finney's status . quiet and enchanting in its simplicity , nobody's fool is a joy . admittedly , it meanders a bit , but that's part of its charm . the intelligent sensitivity of the script , coupled with newman's powerfully understated performance , make this motion picture special . there aren't many of them like this out there . 
when it comes to favorite christmas tales on the screen , there are probably two . there's no confusion about the first , because there is only one it's a wonderful life . in fact , frank capra's classic is so expertly wrought that no one has even attempted a big screen remake . the second is a little more problematic , because there have been many worthy takes on charles dickens' a christmas carol . in 1984 , george c . scott humbugged to memorable effect in a made-for-tv adaptation . but the best-loved and most-remembered version of a christmas carol has to be the 1951 edition of scrooge , with the inimitable alastair sim as london's cruelest miser . sim , a veteran of british stage and screen , started his motion picture career in the mid-'30s and ended it in the early-'70s . sim is not just one of many actors to play the part -- for everyone who has seen the crisply-made black-and-white production , he is the definitive scrooge . at the film's opening , sim radiates cold ; at the end , his giddy exuberance is contagious . in between , we experience many emotions directed towards his character : sadness , anger , and , most strongly , pity . sim makes us feel for scrooge in a way that no other actor has been capable of . take away the lead actor , and this version of scrooge would still have been a credible reworking , with capable performances , a strong atmosphere , and superior costume and set design . the movie was made on an english soundstage in the early 1950s , but the look is of london a century earlier . today , with modern special effects , this would not be as great an achievement as it was more than forty years ago . the black- and-white cinematography , brilliantly achieved by c . pennington- richards , is as crucial to the film's success as any other individual element . rather than making scrooge seem quaint and outdated , the black-and-white approach lends it a sense of eerieness and mystery that no color version has managed to recapture . the plot is faithful to dickens' original tale . ebeneezer scrooge is easily one of the nastiest men in london . sim is supported by an able cast , many of whom are familiar faces . kathleen harrison , whose mrs . dilber was scrooge's comic highlight , had a similarly impressive resume . only michael dolan was hardly ever heard from again . like all uplifting christmas stories , scrooge ends with a flurry of good will and high spirits . but the chief pleasure of watching this version of a christmas carol is not the ending . at a reasonably short 85 minutes , this is nevertheless a complete experience , and the strength and depth of its drama makes it the most memorable of any adaptation of the tale . we may hum along with albert finney , hiss at bill murray , and smile at scrooge mcduck , but none of them compares favorably to sim . when it comes to a christmas carol , perhaps there isn't much of a question about the best version after all ? - ingmar bergman 
this howard hughes rko film first previewed with the title " i married a communist , " but this title did not strike a chord with the audience , so the title was changed and the story reworked so as to make it more of a palatable melodrama than just a vituperative attack on the communists . but it still remains to be seen as mostly a propaganda movie . he seems to have turned over a new leaf with this work experience -- as the film makes a concerted effort to show that work is good for you , that the bosses are benign , that the union can only succeed if it roots out the few commie operators in it who are trying to subvert its legitimate aims , that the communist party is the devil , and that you can't hide from your past mistakes -- so you better think about what you are doing before you sign up for a communist membership , because you can never get out of it once you join . the story was a lot of hokum and misinformation : it distorted the communist influence in the country and how big business and unions act . it attempted to make a propaganda film that reaffirms the american way of life and familial love , but at the expense of reality . if you can somehow get by the polemics and the cheesy script and view this melodrama as typical hollywood , the film is quite entertaining , as it is shot in a dramatic noir style by musuraca and the leads all give able performances , swallowing some of the most tasteless lines ever with a great deal of bravado . 
holy smoke is a beautiful film to watch -- from the feverish credit sequence -- of the film's title written in smoky letters , to kate winslet's psychodelic-like india sojourn , and then onto her trying experiences in the naturally scenic australian outback . the film has perfectly framed scenes and magnificent visuals , and a divertingly amusing storyline to tune into , even if it gives into its own silly side and becomes after a fast start mostly a wonderfully entertaining film touching on many societal nerve points but going nowhere but back into its own cynical view of life , resorting to a politically safe response to all its pin pricks about mind control . though , in all honesty , it should be commended for taking chances and telling its guru story in this refreshingly different style . how perceptive of a film it is , is questionable , as it is provocatively stimulated by overwrought acting and filled with the aussie taste for slapdash comedy and vulgar dialogue . there is too much of a loss of subject context to do any serious intellectual damage about any of the themes it broaches . but it does , on the serious side of its agenda , at least , raise some valid points about mind control and how men treat women . it is scripted by the campion sisters ( jane & anna ) and directed by jane , with a very noticeable woman's touch and a ribald sense of lustiness . at the gathering , there is a gaudily resplendent array of yellow and pink colors to dazzle the senses , seeming more like a light show for a jefferson airplane concert at the fillmore west than a religious ceremony . but mom has trouble adjusting to india : its crowds , lack of modern toilets , and its strange culture . all of their warmth and smiles for her seem disingenuous , especially when compared to the guru's . he also goes heavy on the mouth spray , making sure he is sweet-smelling at all times . the two go off to the outback as p . j . puts into motion his 3-day step program , and the breakdown in the film's sensibility becomes astronomical at this point , making me wonder what the campion sisters were thinking . the film loses its sense of credibility and becomes a battle of the sexes , with the inevitable male-female struggle taking precedence over the heavy-handed religious aspects first introduced into the story . in reality , praying does not guarantee that one's prays will be answered . so , in short , he's not for her , and no matter what he does won't work , which kills the romance part to this screwball comedy . what does this all mean , not too much , except its fun to see keitel get his stereotypical male psyche bruised and ham it up as kate turns the tables on him . but , ah ! those breasts of kate are really something to behold . . . but it is her personality that is the star of the film . she was the only one in the film who wasn't a shallow caricature , and her performance was daring , even smashing , taking this zany script and making the most of it , getting out of it certainly more than it deserved . which means the film actually worked in some skewed sense , as it dove into the question of mind control and the human condition and gave no answers , except the strong suggestion that having compassion for another person is what has to emerge from a person's heart before they can be expected to be free from their karma . and , in a muddled way , this film lets the audience be the observer and lets it come to its own conclusions , which is why i imagine this film will get a mixed-bag of reviews-- ranging from those who can't stand it , to those who rave about it . there were so many wasted moments that blunted this beautifully shot film , that shot itself unecessarily in the foot , even though it did manage to escape from being a dud by its freaky humor and its nonstop assault on the senses of propriety , making this a madcap comedy instead of anything else . it also badly underutilized the talented pam grier , giving her such a miniscule and predictable part , that she had no chance to do her thing . but what it had going for it , is a sense of freedom , an eye for beauty , and kate's undaunting performance , which makes it something to put in your pipe and smoke . if only it wasn't so ridiculous , it could have been a much more salient film , even if it were to lose a few laughs along the way . 
zzzzzzz . in all the pretty horses , directed without an ounce of inspiration by billy bob thornton , the title almost says it all . the only possible things to admire in it are all the pretty horses since the human actors , with the possible exception of matt damon , deliver mind-numbingly dreary and lifeless performances . the horses look surprisingly average but , nevertheless , manage to upstage the lethargic people in the story . ted tally's thinly plotted and prosaically written script is based on cormac mccarthy's novel . going for the poetic , the script instead achieves the soporific . fully 45 minutes pass before anything of consequence happens , and , even then , it is nothing memorable . this might be somewhat tolerable if the actors were able to breathe any humanity into their roles , but they read their lines with the emotional impact of a teacher calling the roll . damon and cruz show absolutely no chemistry whatsoever on the screen , and the beautiful cruz is completely wasted in her part . the romance between john and alejandra not only doesn't have any sparks , it rarely even smolders . but no sooner have we hoped that this thread to the story will take off than it is dropped like a hot potato . in all the pretty horses , it is hard to know whom to blame more , the actors , the director or the screenwriter . the extra-terrestrial ) would be my choice for the worst part of the production . his lack of energy is so pervasive that it seems to suck the life out of those around him . the problem is that we have long since lost any interest in the characters . whether they live or die , we no longer care . all the pretty horses runs a long 1 : 57 . it is rated pg-13 for violence and some sexuality and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up . most kids , however , are going to be bored stiff by the picture .

screenplay : robert benton and richard russo . producers : arlene donovan and scott rudin . director : robert benton . mpaa rating : r ( brief nudity , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 91 minutes . i suspect that there was a great deal of good feeling on the set of twilight , the kind that comes when people believe they're about to make a point . after all , this would be a film where the title could be interpreted two ways . on the other hand , it would describe the cast of veteran actors and the charactes they play , all trying to show they are just as vital in the present as they were in the past . it would be a sly , subtle story brought to life by a group of sly , subtle performers . perhaps too sly and subtle for its own good . as a narrative , twilight offers virtually nothing you haven't seen in a dozen other mysteries set among southern california's privileged set : dirty cops , friends who turn out to be enemies , enemies who turn out to be friends , wads of cash exchanging hands , a little rough stuff , a little gratuitous nudity . sub-plots and supporting characters materialize with alarming frequency , far too many to be fleshed out adequately in the lean 91 minutes provided by robert benton and richard russo's script . twilight introduces enough ideas about decaying affluence and influence that it always seems to be moving forward . it just doesn't feel like it's headed anywhere in particular . the only reason twilight doesn't feel like a thoroughly generic time-waster -- and in fact offers a moderate level of satisfaction -- is the pleasure which comes from watching great actors share the screen . newman wears the layers of disappointment in harry's cop-turned-shamus-turned-drunk life like an old sweater , yet maintains a core of idealistic morality . kramer , nobody's fool ) in his typical restrained style . in fact , the actors are so good that they might trick you into thinking you're watching well-rounded characters . it's only when reese witherspoon , liev schreiber and giancarlo esposito stumble over their underdeveloped parts that it becomes apparent how sketchy those characters truly are . twilight generally feels rushed together as an opportunity for all these actors to appear in a movie together ; for all the talking going on , it's tough to get a handle on who these people really are . there's a fair amount of sharp , tart dialogue to go around . unfortunately , not enough of it is used to bring the characters into focus . harry laughs richly at the rumor when he learns of it , but the film may take the idea a bit more seriously . it's intriguing to watch both the actors and the characters trying to re-define themselves in the present and put their past behind them . and maybe that's even enough subtext to give twilight the edge it needs to make up for its lack of actual text . the story may be only half-finished , but the stars sure aren't . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
quentin tarantino may prove to have a more profound effect on the immediate future of cinema than any other single individual . it's not just that other new filmmakers will be mimicking his style , though such recent fare as love and a . 45 shows that he is already having an influence in that respect . no , tarantino's most important legacy may be that films which until only recently would have seemed doomed to obscurity are finding enthusiastic distribution because the audience has spoken : dark , funny and twisted is * in * . the first beneficiary of the tarantino effect might be the british import shallow grave , a macabre little thriller with some shaky characterizations but a great look and feel . thrillers like shallow grave depend on tight plotting , tense situations and atmosphere , and it hits about two out of three . the point behind disposing of the body is somewhat lost on me , since they could have reported the death without reporting the money , and a few late developments are glossed over so quickly that it's easy for the audience to wonder exactly what happened when . but it is mostly in retrospect that these problems appear , because shallow grave is a pretty intense piece of work . a pair of interviews with a police detective are extremely effective , as you begin to watch the roommates' resolve crumble , and danny boyle's direction highlights a marvelous set , the massive flat shared by juliet , david and alex . the lighting , the bold colors and the seemingly endless hiding places create a mounting paranoia that sweeps you in even as it sweeps in the characters . yet for all its tension and eventual excursions into viscera , shallow grave is essentially a character piece that examines how the fragile relationships between these three individuals are shattered by their shared secret . unfortunately , the other two leads are not nearly as well developed . kerry fox is savvy and manipulative as juliet , but there is something missing , a bit too much left unsaid , particularly her refusal to deal with the men who call for her or approach her at social functions . while the story could have been about how their mutual participation in this event changes all three , it ends up that david is the only one whose state of mind is examined in any depth . still , shallow grave works fundamentally because it keeps the pressure on . it is always only a matter of time before a " perfect crime " is revealed in its imperfection , and the multiple double- crosses are fun to watch . though shallow grave could have been tighter and more psychological , eccleston's intense performance and a few nasty little twists make it a thriller that keeps you watching , guessing and squirming . 
she does have a couple of romantic flings , but the focus of her story , as told in a marvelous and insightful narration by judd , is independence via work . since it is the off season , people are cutting back , not hiring . mitchum gives a good reading of the local rich kid who uses people . judd's performance is the centerpiece of the film . her sincere and calm approach to the character makes ruby compelling without ever being showy or boastful . judd's eyes are sometimes fixed and piercing and at others , rapidly scanning characters to size them up . in another twist , their romance is as sporadic as it is successful , from ruby's perspective . in a show where the main criticism is that , as in life , it sometimes drags , tragedy does eventually occur . most scripts would have the character go through a metamorphosis when under such stress , but not nunez's . ruby uses her same convictions to get her through it and treats it as just another one of the speed bumps of life . the naturally poetic script has ruby confessing toward the end that , " i heard that hell is when all your dreams come true . " she always has a another dream , albeit usually a modest one . it is rated r for sex and brief nudity . the show would be fine for teenagers and they would benefit from seeing a upbeat show with such a positive and subtlety delivered message . i recommend the movie to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : june 20 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
people who exist only in one's imagination are common in childhood and in films . albert is played by haley joel osment in the strongest performance in the movie . haley , whom you may recognize as forrest junior in forrest gump , is as assertive as he is cute . his voice projects with an authority that surpasses many adults . director norman jewison cuts away quickly so as to remove any chance of emotional impact . throughout this uneven movie he will retain this proclivity to shy away from more than surface depth . the characters , albert being the exception , are outlined adequately , but they are only partially filled in , leaving the viewer with a frustratingly incomplete feeling . since albert is white and harriet is black , this might cause some challenges to be dealt with , but this script pays the issue scant attention . graffiti-encased newark is cast against type . rather than its usual collection of drug dealers and gangs , we see it as a friendly working class town . for those of us who have lived in new jersey , albeit not in newark , it is refreshing to see someone look upon its brighter side . although the child actor gives an excellent performance , the adults are merely adequate . depardieu plays his part whimsically , but little more . a more complex interpretation of his character would have helped . she develops little genuine chemistry with anyone else in the picture . it is plausible that harriet starts off tough . but when the inevitable emotional crack finally comes , it happens too late and too unconvincingly . notwithstanding these problems , the film does have its magical moments and none more so than when harriet and bogus are transformed in a daydream to a pair of dancers a la fred astaire and ginger rogers . this scene was presaged earlier in another movie on the television . while always pleasant and sometime downright charming , jewison's film remains strangely uninvolving . the ingredients are there but he has trouble staging them into a compelling whole . bogus runs too long at 1 : 50 . it is rated pg for a little bad language and its more serious themes . it would be fine for kids around 6 and up . my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the film was " okay , but it can get a little boring at times . " since i never disliked the film and since there are several touchingly funny portions , i am giving the film a mild thumbs up and * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
snatch is the second feature film by writer and director guy ritchie , who blasted onto the film scene a couple of years ago with his audacious lock , stock and two smoking barrels . his latest movie is a hyper-violent , screwball comedy that doesn't pull any punches . and it's fun for a time until the repetition factor sets in . coming from the more-is-always-better school of filmmaking , ritchie tries to fill every fast-paced scene with maximum violence and mayhem . snatch , which has more characters and overlapping stories that you can count , never has a slow moment . in the predictable script , you can probably guess exactly how he will be relieved of the stone . many of the characters , like boris , can take more bullets than the agents in the matrix and still keep on coming . individual incidents are cute although few rise to the level of laugh-out-loud funny . animal rights people may find many of the fighting animal scenes more than they can stomach even if the movie undoubtedly promises that no animals were harmed , etc . as the ending credits roll , the song it plays has the constant refrain , " ha , ha , ha , ha . the movie is like that -- way too repetitive . snatch runs 1 : 43 . it is rated r for strong violence , language and some nudity and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older . 
sirens is a witty , fanciful , and wonderfully upbeat comedy with a dramatic side as well . the women , i believe , are all relatively newcomers to the screen . all of the performances were delightful . the nude models were played like pixies . when they smile , joy leaps through your heart . many great scenes in the show . the pixies swinging in the glimmering moonlight was magical . there was a drunk who said an unprintable 2 word phrase again and again that was very funny . the cinematography ( geoff burton ) was superb . the night scenes with the exaggerated back lighting of the moon were lovely . duigan directed them so that it seemed as if these actors and actresses had been working together forever . it is rated r . if a lot of female and male full frontal nudity is a problem for you , then skip sirens since it is best described as a very nude enchanted april ; otherwise , i recommend this show to you and give it * * * . it is a fine show for teenagers unless they are sensitive to nudity . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : march 14 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
director : uli edel . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , mild profanity , violence ) running time : 95 minutes . the little vampire falls squarely in the center of the " family film " continuum -- a place few family films tend to occupy . on one end , we find those films that appeal to viewers of all ages with imagination and a lack of pandering ( toy story , e . t . , beauty and the beast ) . on the other end , we find those films that appeal either to marketing concerns ( pokemon , mighty morphin power rangers ) or toilet humor ( most live-action disney films of the last decade ) . true mediocrity in family filmmaking is quite a rarity , which makes the little vampire an intriguing pop culture curiosity : it's a simple and whimsical tale that keeps flirting with inappropriateness . like the protagonists in e . t . , and/or " cool ! " jim carter , in his tex cobb-circa-raising arizona wardrobe , makes for a good nasty-comic villain , and the script ( co-written by chicken run and james and the giant peach scribe karey kirkpatrick ) includes at least a few clever lines like , " it's not easy for a father to hear , but your son is a blood-sucking fiend . " much of it is silly , but there's also a dark side that many of the better children's tales have always had . there's also a perplexing dose of questionable content . you see , anna is a 307-year-old in a 7-year-old's body , making her advances slightly more sophisticated than giggles and goo-goo eyes . in fact , in one scene she sits on tony's bed and -- in her best lauren bacall come-hither tones -- asks tony , " you know how to whistle , don't you ? " though it's likely to go right over the heads of the very young , there's something icky about using a lascivious pre-pubescent as a punch line -- even ickier than the giant pasture patty dropped from the sky by a flying vampire cow during the film's " far side " -meets-john hughes climax . it's not terribly surprising to find the little vampire straying from the kid-friendly straight-and-narrow , considering it was directed by uli edel , the man behind such innocent entertainments as last exit to brooklyn and madonna's 1993 sex stinker body of evidence . edel's pacing is fairly sluggish for a children's film , and the rest of it is a bit too bland for parents to get excited about . yet there's still some fun adventure here , and it's not all designed to get its viewers to buy action figures . it's hard to know quite how enthusiastic to be about a family film that's occasionally pitched at the wrong crowd , but at least isn't stupid or actively offensive most of the time . and that , unfortunately , is a sad statement on " family " filmmaking in 2000 : simple mediocrity is starting to look pretty good . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
one fine day has all the ingredients of an enjoyable romantic comedy : a decent premise , likable leads , and a solid supporting cast . michelle pfeiffer and george clooney make an appealing couple . unfortunately , one fine day keeps them separated for much of its running time . those elements are filler , and , because we want to see more of melanie and jack together , they're unwanted and irritating . one fine day also moves at a breakneck pace , with a digital readout of the time occasionally appearing on screen to remind us that the hours and minutes are rushing by . the contrivance of having a series of deadlines that come and go makes everything seem frantic . everyone in this film is under constant pressure , so there's no time for a quiet moment of dialogue . it's all rather exhausting , with a payoff that isn't adequate for what we go through to get there . one saving grace is that the child actors , mae whitman and alex d . linz , give natural , unaffected performances . they don't call attention to themselves , and , as a bonus , neither is so insufferably cute that you feel the sudden desire to strangle them . both consistently respond to all of one fine day's crazy circumstances the same way any normal kid might , and they mesh well with their older , more experienced co-stars . however , as a romantic comedy , this is a spotty affair because it's not really funny or romantic enough . keeping the leads apart might work for something like sleepless in seattle , where the intention is to develop an old-fashioned , long-distance romance , but , in a movie like this -- one that's being pulled in so many directions that it's coming apart at the seams -- it's a mistake . for much of its running length , one fine day lacks focus and direction , and that makes it one fine mess . 
it's easy to become hooked on the fantasies , and , especially with a little marijuana to augment the experience , reality can become a tenuous thing . when it comes to details , girl 6 is excellent . the phone sex mantra is simple : " listen , appreciate , and don't judge -- you want them to like you . " unfortunately , as good as girl 6 is with the fine points , the larger brushstrokes are erratic . lee may have a keen sense of setting and dialogue , but his characterization is off . other than judy , no one has any depth , and even she isn't afforded much development . theresa randle ( sugar hill , malcolm x ) is okay in the role , but not a revelation . unlike exotica , which cut deeply into the motivations of those who work in and frequent strip clubs , this film is content to skim the surface of a similar industry . one scene of poignant disillusionment notwithstanding , judy's burgeoning addiction to the illusory aspects of her job is used more as a plot device than a means of exploring her psyche . the question is raised , although lee doesn't really probe it . while girl 6 is considerably more effective than showgirls at exploring the issue , there are times when this film seems like the proverbial triumph of style over substance . cinematographer malik hassan sayeed , who worked with lee on clockers , uses a battery of odd camera angles and experimental shots . most of these work on a purely visual level , but their attempts to telegraph emotional states are less successful . the highlights of the film are a trio of parody fantasies . give lee credit for using madonna and tarantino in roles they're capable of playing . if nothing else , girl 6's perspective of the industry is fascinating . the stereotype is that they're ugly , wrinkled , and haggard . the reality , at least in girl 6 , is somewhere in between . none of the revelations here are especially shocking -- we've seen a lot of this stuff before , anywhere from tv news magazines to robert altman's short cuts ( where jennifer jason leigh played a phone sex girl ) , but lee puts it all together and adds a few twists . unfortunately , while certain aspects of girl 6 are handled with flair , the film's dramatic scope too often isn't compelling enough for subject matter of such rich and varied possibilities . 
tammy faye bakker , " the first lady of christian broadcasting , " was at the center of the biggest real-life soap opera of the 1980s . the documentary argues convincingly that the only sin of tammy faye , a likeable little dynamo , is her unquestioning naivet ? . the villain of the piece turns out to be jerry falwell . whether this represents the ultimate truth or not may never be known , but the documentary offers compelling evidence to support its case . all of the above notwithstanding , the reason to see the movie is to meet a fascinating and resourceful woman with a very interesting background . although the title refers to tammy's signature heavy eye make-up , it could be titled the eyes of the viewers since your eyes will be glued to the screen in this intriguing tale . in an age in which reality programming is popular , this movie would seem to have arrived at just the right moment in time . forget daytime soaps , none could be better than this movie . these humorous puppets are appropriate since jim and tammy's first television show was a christian broadcast done howdy doody style . the remarkably good-spirited documentary offers up lots of opportunities to laugh but none are at tammy faye's expense . the internecine warfare among the leaders of the christian broadcasting community is shown to be much more vicious than outsiders would ever imagine . an unabashed believer in the importance of happiness in worship ( " we believe that we were one of the first people to put fun and joy in religion . " ) , if he isn't shown to be quite as likeable as tammy faye , jim still comes across as an ambitious man with a good heart who made some mistakes . in short , he just appears human , and high profile political figures guilty of much more than he have thrived . most of all , tammy faye is a survivor . jim j . bullock , a gay comedian and , at one time , tammy's television talk-show host , says it best about tammy faye's skills . it is rated pg-13 for some sexual content and would be acceptable for any kids old enough to be interested in the material . 
a screwball comedy that is conceptually funny but the more ridiculous it gets as the story picks up its pace the less funny it seems . it never has an edge to it , therefore it seems more like a sitcom than a comedy/drama . drama and characterization are thrown out the window , and contrivances rule the day . . . which allow the home fries to become too tasteless to enjoy . but the film just can't get above the absurdity of its bizarre tale to say much more about why everyone is so screwed up or make the romance between the shy dorian ( the good brother ) and sally feel like it belongs in the film . these two are not believable as lovers , as i saw no sparks flying from them . also the murder plot is just not that funny , and when it becomes more involved , it just becomes a sick joke that goes on for too long ; and , the film ends with a one-too many helicopter scene that couldn't be more ridiculous . the film had all the hints of going somewhere in its opening premise , but it seemed to get stuck , not knowing how to tell a story about what the film really should have been about , the quest of dorian and sally for a normal life despite their dysfunctional up-bringing . being a weirdo does not make one necessarily an interesting character . that is a lesson that this first-time director should take away from this failed effort at dark humor . it should be mentioned that there was one appetizing scene in the movie , as dorian escorts sally to lamaze class and we see them go through those exercises ; it is still a good scene even if it is still not clear why he does so . i just had the feeling he felt sorry for her , rather than that he was in love with her , as i presume the director wanted us to believe . this is a film that might please those who frequent fast-food places and don't worry about their cholestral count and indigestion . in other words , the film moved along at a fast pace , there wasn't much to think about , and might be just the thing for those who would consider this a date movie and not be concerned that it didn't deliver a heavier meal . as for me , i try to eat junk food only when i'm stuck on the road and am starving to death . in this case , since i wasn't stuck on the road , my excuse for eating this junk food was that i was enticed to try something new they were advertising on the menu , but after tasting it , i felt it was just like the same old stuff they always serve in those places , and i just wasn't hungry enough to appreciate that . 
after the smash romantic thriller ghost and the suspense mystery jacob's ladder , rubin had already staked his claim to status as master of metaphysical melodrama . now comes his feature directorial debut , my life , which again ventures into issues of life and death . the results are extremely mixed . when my life scores , it scores big ; when it misses , it misses big . to his credit , rubin avoids the glycerine-soaked excesses that plagued ghost . this isn't a big-screen version of a " disease of the week " tv-movie ; it's a contemplative , almost spiritual story buoyed by the small but crucial role of the healer played by haing s . ngor . ngor projects a serenity which permeates the film , the effect of his splendid scenes with keaton lingering long after the scenes themself end . in fact , my life may be surprisingly over-subtle when it requires a moment of real catharsis . too much of bob's struggle is kept beneath the surface , and as a result i was left with a truckload of questions about who bob jones really was . by far , the best thing about my life is michael keaton . those who remember his impressive performance in clean and sober know that keaton can be a fine dramatic actor when he has good material , and my life provides him with some fine moments . the best are those which play to his cocky comic sensibility . there is real charm to the scenes of bob's videotaped instructions to his yet-to-be-born son on such vital issues as shaving , basketball and entering a room . when it comes to the more serious elements , keaton doesn't have as much to work with . my life is supposed to be about a change in bob jones' life , but we don't get a clear enough picture of who he was before his illness to make it evident that there has been a change . rubin ignores the basic dramatic rule of " show , don't tell " by having another character say that bob " isn't exactly an example of an examined life . " that's a quality i just don't feel i * saw * . my life also caught me just as i had reached my breaking point in terms of tolerating saintly cinematic wives/girlfriends with no discernible personalities of their own . nicole kidman's gail is a complete blank , spending far too much of the time radiating dangerously high levels of understanding . i was left completely untouched by the crucial love story because i never believed that there were two human beings involved . instead , i saw one human being and one porcelain figurine with lots of hair . kidman's one genuine moment , a very funny line in the middle of gail's labor pains , was shocking because it was the first time gail seemed to be made of flesh . the fact that it's bob's story doesn't mean that gail can't be well-written , and she is not . in spite of my distaste for the love story , i was ready to be far more positive in my recommendation of my life until its final fifteen minutes . after a solid opening , alternately entertaining and introspective , my life just peters out . bruce joel rubin the auteur didn't have enough other people pushing him to flesh out his characters or fill in the holes in an otherwise affecting story . 
grief is a difficult subject for a motion picture to address . handled improperly , the emotion can be conveyed as shallow and insincere . a hollywood film's insatiable need to contain feel-good moments invariably diverts scripts in this direction . moonlight and valentino represents a constant struggle between presenting a heartfelt examination of the effects of an unexpected death and manipulating the audience . the function of a solid performance should be to elevate an intelligent script to the next level . in moonlight and valentino , however , the actors save a rather ordinary screenplay from going down the drain . there's nothing radically wrong with the material--it's just mundane and predictable . the movie doesn't contain any surprises , and there are times when the legitimacy of the characters' emotions are in question . those wanting an astonishingly genuine portrait of grief should check out krzysztof kieslowski's vastly superior blue ( the first film in his three colors trilogy ) . as good as elizabeth perkins is here , she can't hold a candle to juliette binoche's emotionally shattered julie . none of these women are the picture of psychological stability , however . perkins isn't moonlight and valentino's sole shining beacon of acting . gwyneth paltrow ( flesh and bone , seven ) gives a wonderful performance , mixing a natural upbeat energy with expressive eyes . paltrow is also blessed with the rare ability to deliver corny lines of dialogue in a completely natural fashion . whoopi goldberg and kathleen turner , however , are not as impressive , with goldberg seeming especially flat . perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film is the facile manner in which it resolves all the various emotional tribulations . the ending of moonlight and valentino is so silly and over-the-top that it's more likely to have the viewer shaking her or his head than reaching for a kleenex . admittedly , there are moments likely to prompt a tear or two , but there's also quite a bit that doesn't ring true . many of the interpersonal conflicts ( such as lucy and alberta's strained relationship ) feel like scripted contrivances ; it's only when the story delves into the characters' inner turmoil that it strikes the right chord . predictably , the result is a mixed bag--a study of grief and friendship that might have been more effective had the script been better-focused and the director's approach less heavy-handed . 
as you sit watching bonnie hunt's adult fairy tale , return to me , it's easy to convince yourself that this old-fashioned romance must be a remake of some 1940's movie . with its sweetly sappy scenes of love and courtship , it tells a delightful story that is a throwback to a simpler time at the cinema . then it hits you . this can't be remake of something that you saw decades ago because the kickoff point for the plot concerns a medical procedure ( heart transplant ) that hasn't been around very long . this is where the magic in the plot comes in . when bob first lays eyes on grace , both smile and feel like they've met before . the chemistry between the lovers is genuine and never rushed . the parts of the script that challenge the pg rating are the intensity of the early tragedy . sex isn't part of the storyline . the result of the discovery is predictable , but who cares . this heart-warming movie ( pun intended ) is an unabashedly sentimental love story , not a mystery . return to me runs 1 : 53 . it is rated pg for language and thematic elements and would be fine for kids around 10 and up . my son jeffrey , almost 11 , liked all of the movie except for the initial tragedy . giving it * * * , he said that he found the movie hilarious and that he especially liked seeing carroll o'connor . 
date released : varies running length : 2 : 00 rated : nr ( sex , nudity , violence , mature themes ) starring : misa shimizu , takehiro murata , takeo nakahara director : takehiro nakajima producer : takehiro nakajima screenplay : takehiro nakajima music : hiroshi ariyoshi released by cinevista japanese with english subtitles first and foremost , okoge is an examination of the difficulties faced by gay men in a society as conservative and restrictive as that in japan . actually , many of the themes of the movie , as well as the problems encountered by the main characters , have universal implications . too often , one of the problems with movies involving homosexual themes and issues is a tendency to sermonize . instead of letting the characters and story bring the message to the fore , each of those films felt it necessary to preach about the evils of a homophobic society . for the most part , okoge avoids this pitfall . there are a few scenes that are too obviously scripted ( such as one in which a bunch of gay men sit around debating whether their sexual preference is the result of genetics or environment ) , but the movie generally allows the natural flow of its plot to explore issues , rather than relying on unconvincing contrivances . okoge also has a sense of humor . not a deadly-serious movie , this is instead a picture that is unafraid to let the audience laugh . most of the jokes are at the expense of the homophobes in the film , and they are crafted skillfully enough to get the point across--and be funny--without becoming condescending . nevertheless , all is far-from-perfect with okoge . instead of being a cohesive whole , it's more like two films , each very different in quality and tone from the other . the only constant is the characters . the first seventy-five minutes of okoge is a skillfully-done character study , focusing on the unusual menage a trois that exists between sayoko , goh , and tochi . from that moment on , okoge is never the same . the film takes its last twenty minutes to resolve the various messes that the main trio have gotten themselves into . although a little on the sweet side , the ending is nicely-done , showing that love and sex don't have to be two sides to the same coin , but there's nearly forty minutes of confusion between the excellent beginning of okoge and its conclusion . i've never before seen japanese actress misa shimizu , but her performance in this film is an eye-opener . she puts an incredible amount of energy into her performance . i'm not sure how the character was written , but shimizu's rendering of sayoko positively sparkles . the two male leads aren't quite as good , but neither murata nor nakahara does a bad job . okoge may not be an ideal movie , but it goes a long way towards removing the bad taste left behind by such heavy-handed efforts as the living end and claire of the moon . not only does it give an intelligent , sympathetic portrayal of the difficulties of a gay lifestyle , but it presents them from a woman's point-of-view . credit should be given to takehiro nakajima for daring to make this film in a country with such a rigid social structure . the strengths of okoge certainly outweigh the weaknesses . 
anne and pierre , who live together with their adorable toddler , experienced theirs at the cinema . in la separation , a film whose meanings are revealed mainly in subtle nuances of the characters' body language , anne's outright admission of her displeasure forms one of the story's more explicitly dramatic moments . eventually , anne will nonchalantly tell pierre that she has fallen in love with someone else -- someone " who pays attention to me . " isabelle huppert , winner of the french best actress award in 1996 for la ceremonie , plays anne , the film's enigma . an attractive professional with deep brown eyes , anne possesses a breezy confidence . she does what she wants in life and isn't the least bit concerned how it might affect those around her . whether she's happy or sad , she keeps her emotions firmly in check . daniel auteuil , winner of the french best actor award in 1996 for the eighth day , plays pierre . still , as long as she does not leave , pierre's willing to go along with this . on the surface they look like a completely contented couple . the story by dan franck and the director , christian vincent , is as remarkable for the scenes that don't occur as those that do . the big angry outbursts are almost totally absent , and anne's other lover is only discussed but never shown . in the typically french style , the characters talk incessantly . cinematographer denis lenoir keeps the camera rigid during these talkfests , letting the two characters' heads and shoulders fill the frame . the movie is a character study , and the director clearly wants us to focus on the two leads . la separation is a subtle movie in which facial expressions are where the action is . the film is in french with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be pg-13 for a little profanity and mature themes and would be fine for teenagers . 
this escapist movie is sponsored in part by sega , influenced in part by the death threat on indian author salmun rushdie , and it sure feels like a '60s bad acid trip ala video game that the twelve game players in the film are into . burroughs influenced cronenberg with the idea that what you create as an artist becomes a living thing , it goes out into the world and has a life of its own but is still connected to you . so far , so good . it is pronounced with philosophical pretensions as " eggs is tense . " and two heads are better than one . these could be some slogans for a game that has no explanation or purpose for its existence . you get to know about it only when you play it . to play the game , means you have to penetrate the body by means of bio ports , which are openings in the spine . that's a fleshy lump with several nipples , and it's meant to be stroked by game players . you see the obvious allusions to sex in the game's foreplay . all this game stuff is really not that interesting to see . the two stars are only mildly diverting , arousing no particular warm feelings for their plight . their aim is to provide suspense and a dark sense of humor , which they do on occasion . but they fail in achieving any depth in their characters ; therefore , they are seen only as being the game figures they are portraying . the main supporting cast includes willem dafoe as gas and ian holm as kiri . both in minor roles . he replies , " only on the most pathetic level of reality . " kiri is a game character who talks with a thick european accent . for allegra , her pod is vital , as it holds the only formula to the game in it . the film sinks downhill from here on . but much of the story just didn't add up and the virtual reality didn't look so hot , either . the only thing left to be accomplished was a surprise ending , and that comes as sure as a heart attack . the only thing is , that the surprise ending really came too late too save the film , and if you thought about it , it didn't make sense , unless you believe that the two best game players were ironically the one's who were really anti-gamers ; that is , inspite of their negative energy they were still able to excel in the game . he said , " tell me the truth , are we still in the game ? " cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film , he needs a good script and actors who are more suited for their roles . the biggest mistake was in the casting of jude law as a romantic hero . virtual reality story left me thinking that it could have been done with more fluidity and feeling . 
some people have the gift , but others are lacking . first time feature film director alan taylor tries his had at a farce with palookaville . perhaps taylor has promise , but palookaville is on the debit side of almost everyone's ledger who has a part in it . well , i've never read the stories , but i hope they are not as shallow as this movie . perhaps with a more deft approach , this scene could have been funny , but david epstein's script lacks much subtlety . russ says they should stick to their original plan since , " i'm not talking about a life of crime , just a momentary shift in lifestyle . " russ is a dreamer . you can have fresh squeezed orange juice every day . if you've got a back yard there , you've got fresh fruit . " actually , there is only one part of the film i like . and vice versa of course . in a better movie , i might have criticized this little romantic subplot as needless , but here i appreciated the diversion from the plodding main plot . i am a fan of mcdormand's , but her performance in palookaville is lifeless . in a film that tries to charm you , but is so dreadfully dull that boredom is the only consist reaction to it , there is one funny little scene . they are studiously taking notes , and this does arouse suspicions in ed . palookaville is mercifully only 1 : 33 long . it is rated r for brief nudity and strong language . the film would be fine for any teenager . i see no reason to waste your time with it so it gets a big thumbs down from me and a measly single * only for bridgit ryan's small part . the press kit says she will be in great expectations with robert de niro , ethan hawke , and gwyneth paltrow so she will get a much better chance than this slight movie . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
mouse hunt , the first kids' movie from the new dreamworks studio , should come with a warning . later in the review i'll cover some of the picture's questionable aspects . the dark movie opens with a funeral . the house is correctly described as " cold and spooky , " and phedon papamichael's creepy , dark cinematography adds to the fright . asked the kid behind me , clearly upset . ) alan silvestri's whimsical music tries to set a happier mood to the picture . with a doa performance by the two leads , the mouse shows up and almost saves the picture . when the brothers slice off a piece of cheese to put it on a mouse trap , the mouse rolls the entire cheese wheel away instead . the only smart thing they do is hire caesar the exterminator -- smart because christopher walken's militarily precise performance is the only decent one by a human being in the movie . the most imaginative sequence in the film has the mouse running behind the walls , chased by a series of nails being hammered into the wall . needless to say , the kids are apt to be to scared by this scene as it looks like the mouse is about to die a horrible death . first-time movie director gore verbinski , whose background is television commercials , manages to maintain interest in the show's black comedy for about thirty minutes , but after that repetition sets in . the mouse's acrobatics always delight , but banged heads have a limited appeal . as promised , i'll cover some of the inappropriate parts of the movie . first , the tone is extremely dark . in a particularly gross scene , the exterminator eats mouse feces as an investigative technique . in the sexually questionable category are a series of fondlings that occur at the end . these scenes have no place in a pg movie with a theater filled with young kids . ( i checked and was not able to find any other reviewers who have mentioned the movie's questionable parts . how can they be so oblivious to the sensibilities of the movie's target audience ? don't any of the reviewers have kids ? ) the movie ends in one of its few upbeat moments . the ending possesses the intelligent and good spirited humor that the rest of the movie so often lacks . it is incorrectly rated pg and should be considered questionable for kids under 10 . my son jeffrey , age 8 , spent most of the movie so scared that he was shaking , but said he wanted to stay . in the end he claimed he thought the movie was " great and funny . " he went on to say that he wanted to advise parents that " if you don't like bugs or mice or bloody scenes or if your child gets scared easily , don't see it . " his friend matthew , age 9 , said the movie was " a rich and cheesy deal , but it was good . " both of them said they liked home alone 3 much better because it had more action , was funnier and wasn't so gross . 
to die for is the movie that finally proves that nicole kidman can act . she does the best rendition of an airhead that i can remember . although it sometimes get a bit tedious and monotonous , her performance never gets contrived or corny . many scenes follow of both sets of parents being interviewed on an oprah style television talk show . what kind of personality is not important to her , only fame is . as she puts it , " you aren't really anybody in america if you're not on tv . " jane , she whispers to the audience , has " a tiny weight problem you know . " the cinematography ( eric alan ) of about a third of the movie is a documentary style of talking heads and with a handheld camera full of numerous pans and zooms . in a continuing series , we have an excellent performance by janice in her ice-skates talking about larry and about how much she hated suzanne . suzanne then goes on to point out how gorbachev would probably still be in power if had had plastic surgery on his birthmark . in an autobiographical monologue that runs through the whole show , suzanne pontificates about life . she is always upbeat and smiling , and she explains that " it's nice to live in a country where life , liberty , and other stuff , stand for something . " coming so close to the conclusion of the farcical simpson circus , some viewers may find this part tragic rather than comical . the script by buck henry and gus van sant jr . and based on the novel by joyce maynard is filled with scenes so hilarious that i had almost uncontrollable laughter . that is the good news . the bad is that there are wastelands of dead time between the laughs . the problem with the non-funny parts is that the writers have not created characters that you care about so that no matter how great kidman's acting is and no matter how hard you laughed ten minutes ago , you don't care if the characters get used , abused , or shot . dillon , for example , doesn't have much of a part , and he certainly does nothing memorable with it . as a director , i find gus van sant jr . 's style too eclectic for my taste . this is not surprising since his last film was that major bomb , even cowgirls get the blues . nevertheless , i do like to die for . they do a wonderful job of making suzanne into an extremely made up woman in very brief miniskirts and yet they never go over the line and overdo it . the pushed her look to the absolute limit , but never made her look sleazy . to die for runs 1 : 40 , and i think the editors ( jeffrey arsenault and curtiss clayton ) should have left a few more entire scenes on the cutting room floor so that the meantime to laugher was much smaller . the movie is rated r for sex , understated violence , some profanity , and about one second of nudity from a far distance . it is a soft r , and i would see no problem in teenagers seeing the show . there were certainly many in the audience where i was . i give to die for a thumbs up for kidman's performance , for interesting docudrama style cinematography , and for some huge laughs , and i award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : october 6 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
nicholas meyer , a talented writer/director who likes developing interesting characters and situations out of genre types ( the seven per cent solution , star trek iv : the voyage home ) , made his directorial debut with 1979's time after time . unfortunately , while this science fiction/thriller has a premise with tremendous promise , the execution is hampered by obvious plot holes , inconsistent characters , and uneven acting . despite all its flaws , however , time after time still remains an entertaining--and occasionally fascinating--two hours , as well as a favorite among meyer fans . it's amusing to see wells cope with modern-day traffic patterns , television , and fast food restaurants . in fact , his pursuit of the ripper is often far less engaging than watching him struggle to understand the complexities of life in the late '70s . while mcdowell is fine as wells , david warner plays the ripper as a run-of-the-mill psychopath--not at all the sort of fascinating , diabolical villain necessary to keep this film moving . all things considered , jack is more likely to provoke a yawn than a surge of terror . meyer's script distances him from us so that we never feel anything particularly strong for or against him . despite a certain charm and appeal , mary steenburgen , in one of her early roles , is awkward as amy . this character is supposed to be a smart , assertive , liberated woman , yet the story continually places her in contrived and vulnerable positions . at times , her actions are more like those of a typical female victim in a slasher movie than a heroine worthy of h . g . wells' attention . there are a lot of nice touches in time after time , but the overall plot is too obviously scripted . when a certain element in the time machine's construction is carefully pointed out twice , we know it's going to become important . this sort of thing happens repreatedly in time after time--unsubtle hints at what's coming next . fortunately , in future features , meyer's direction would lose much of that heavy- handedness . it's more of a lighthearted fantasy/romance with a few thriller elements thrown in . indeed , the movie might have worked better had jack the ripper not been around at all . alas , he is the engine that keeps the plot moving , and there are times when his very presence weighs down this movie like a proverbial albatross . 
from this initial plot setup the show is filled with many characters and takes numerous twists and turns . you can see any of them without seeing any of the others since they are all unrelated in any real sense . who are all of the other minor , but important characters in what is essentially a two person drama , and what is the purpose of their roles ? even more slowly we begin to see what importance he will have to the model's future . we know much more about every character , but much is left unknown . you may hate the ending , you may like , or you may just be confused by it all . on the suggestion box in the show , someone had written , " i wish you would explain to me what red was all about " . personally , i liked the ending and found it consistent with the rest of the movie . go to the bathroom before you enter the theater ; you will not want to miss a minute of the dialog . the writing is crisp , and the pacing is deliberately and correctly slow . much to ponder in every scene . the camerawork is quite imaginative in the angles it uses yet it is never cutesy . the show was filmed too dark for me , but i am sure this was carefully chosen to reflect the somber mood of the piece . as good as the leads were , the director/writer deserves most of the credit . other than filming it a bit brighter , what else would i change ? well , i would have liked to have seen the character of the model opened up a bit more . i would have also preferred to see some of the minor characters developed more . on the whole though , i would not change much . at the end of the movie , an older gentlemen struck up a conversation with me for some reason . what do you think it was about ? " i reflected a moment and then told him to me the show was teaching us that your life is an enigma , but ultimately you have a destiny with someone and that destiny will eventually be revealed to you . he said he could see my theory too . if any of you see it , let me know what you think its message was . the timing is good , and the show runs 1 : 39 . it is rated r for adult material and for one 5 second scene of a nude man from the rear . any aged teenager who likes serious adult mysteries would enjoy this show . i recommend it to everyone over 12 , and i give * * * 1/2 . this is a film that has you thinking long after you leave the theater . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
mpaa rating : not rated ( brief nudity , profanity , boxing violence ) running time : 90 minutes . a study of two figures from the glory days of boxing is only part of what when we were kings tries to deliver , however , and it is only the chance to see ali at his verbal and physical finest which grips you while much of the film drifts off on tangents . part of gast's focus in when we were kings involves the extraordinary nature of the event itself . foreman , meanwhile , could not understand why he was treated like the villain , or worse , ignored entirely . gast frequently moves back and forth between preparation for the fight itself and peripheral events , but this technique ends up muddling when we were kings about as often as it enriches it . an air conditioning failure at the musicians' hotel has everyone in a tizzy , but we never hear about it again ; the anecdotes involving extreme measures taken by zaire's dictator mobutu sese seko to clean up the country for foreign press are interesting , but gast doesn't tell us how the delay affected those efforts . it also doesn't help that gast can't quite decide whether when we were kings is a piece of social history or a piece of sports history . yet gast appears to deal with the actual fight as a necessary evil , or as padding to fill out a documentary about something else which was struggling to make feature length . when we were kings might be a few different documentaries crammed into one film , but it still delights whenever muhammad ali is center stage . more than anything else , gast wants the film to act as a memorial to the charismatic ali who never failed to provide a quote or a headline . the portrait that emerges captures ali at his cocky , trash-talking , rhyme-spinning finest , but it also shows the deeply committed muslim who viewed his trip to zaire as a kind of pilgrimage . 
these misguided adventures are things a kid needing but not getting parental help might do . he considers these episodes to be ernest hemingway-like experiences . the film with all its fantastic developments and its obscure way to tell a story , still remains grounded in reality , accurately picturing the wasteland of suburban life in the 1980s . the charming adrian grenier is appealing to a certain extent as the hero who is both naive and adventurous in a self-destructive way . clark gregg plays his role as someone who feels inside like a woman , but who has been a man so long and still looks like one , that there is certain smugness he has that he can be both a man and a woman . but , the story never leaps beyond its startling revelation of a father undergoing a sex change and the devastating reaction it has for his family . it seems to wither towards its climax . when we see him hitting baseballs at a batting range and then beating up someone who makes fun of him , we're into a typical macho hollywood response mode to such problems , and it becomes apparent that this character will remain underdeveloped . the film setups an engaging story but didn't take it anywhere special , as it was a let down after such a fast start and such a promising look at a youngster needing guidance and getting it from such an unlikely source as gregg . you can rest assured , that this offbeat teenager comedy/drama , returns safely back to its genre's teen movie fold by the film's end , and that is its main fault . 
okay , admit it . you hate opera . you've known this fact since childhood and have never wavered in your opinion . you've actually never seen a real opera . flipping the dial and having accidentally seen a few minutes on pbs doesn't count . if this syllogism fits you , then i have just the movie for you . after watching the utterly lifeless madame butterfly , you will confidently be to proclaim that you were right all along . opera is a musical hoax perpetrated by a bunch of rich intellectuals . as mark twain put it about one opera composer , " i am told that his music is better than it sounds . " being a big opera buff , i can testify that opera is one of god's gifts to mankind , but as in all things , there are bad examples . french documentary director frederic mitterand's madame butterfly is devoid of energy and the singing quality is minimal . in the spirit of full disclosure , i should admit that " madame butterfly " is not one of my favorite of puccini's operas , nevertheless , the production of it does not have to be this boring . this is one of the many flaws in the staging . the singers he chose have modest voices with little resonance or interest . huang's voice is quite undeveloped and shallow , and troxell's voice is a little too high pitched and almost seems to squeak . only cowan has a voice that commands attention . the other singers in the cast are unmemorable . ah , the dialog . all operas are full of silly little lines , and this one is no exception . so much sky . look , we've reached the top . so many flowers . " my biggest problem with the movie is the staging . the actors give frozen gestures , and their movements are leaden . if the singing was exceptional , you could probably ignore the staging , but it isn't . the singers in this film have minuscule acting ability so they bring little to their roles to compel the audience's attention . troxell , for example , has exactly two expressions . the only reason to bring an opera to the screen is to open it up , but here most scenes are in or about the house giving the picture a claustrophobic feeling . on an opera stage , you would expect this , but not in a movie . as you probably all know , the story has a tragic ending . here the actors' lack of ability mutes its effect , but the ending does breathe into the show its only semblance of life . i will say this about the film , there are a few classic arias that are pleasant to hear again even if they are not particularly well done . on the good side , the cinematography by philippe welt and the sets by michele abbe-vannier are full of warm browns . the interiors scenes are the best , and the wooden tones radiate with a peaceful glow . exterior shots are less effective , but the ones of the morning haze are particularly lovely . if you do go , make sure you go early or drink lots of coffee . this film is a great cure for insomnia . being a critic , i forced myself to see it all , and since the press screening was in the morning after four cups of coffee , i was wide awake . it is in italian with english subtitles . at the time of the press screening , it was not rated by the mpaa , but it is a g film for every reason except possibly for the theme which might get it a pg . there is no sex , nudity , or bad language . there is a little underdone and unrealistic violence at the end . the film would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested . i can not recommend this tepid attempt at turning an opera into a movie . i give the movie a single * for a few good arias . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
it's okay for a horror film to be a metaphor ; in fact , they can work best on an underlying psychological level . a scary film can be more than just scary , but it shouldn't work so hard at it that the whole thing becomes a pretentious , preposterous mess . ravenous is just such a convoluted concoction , throwing mountains of sub-text at its tale of cannibalism in the vain hope that something might stick , instead of merely " ick . " every once in a while , when ravenous settles down for some good old-fashioned terror tension , you can almost enjoy it . there are a few nicely staged confrontations and creepy moments in antonia bird's direction ( or perhaps that of milcho manchevski , the director replaced two weeks into production ) , including a sequence involving a sneak attack that builds far longer than you might think possible . writer ted griffin slips a few darkly comic lines into the dialogue , and robert carlyle's manic performance helps support that tone whenever he's on screen . how much more tolerable ravenous might have been if griffin and bird had been content to let the black comedy guide them . instead , it becomes a potpourri of narrative notions and random themes : the dehumanizing destruction of battle ( i . e . , war itself as cannibalism ) , the mad drive for the american frontier ( i . e . , the manifest destiny as cultural/ecological cannibalism ) , the equally mad drive for the gold in them thar hills ( i . e . , the gold rush as economic cannibalism ) , plus yet another gloss on addiction , and on and on to a dizzying degree , with the native american myth of the weendigo thrown in for good measure . boyd's tortured quandary over whether to join this particular diners' club is played as such grand opera , infused with such socio-political baggage , that guy pearce looks like he's carrying the entire weight of western civilization on his shoulders in every scene . no one's saying that the jaunty gruesomeness of eating raoul is the only possible approach for a successful foray into same-species snacking . it may , however , be the best approach . when jeffrey jones is cracking wise while supping on a human stew , ravenous begins to emerge from its coma of self-importance ; when he pleads to be relieved of the misery of his hunger , you wonder when he suddenly developed a character of any significance . at a certain point , ravenous becomes so consumed with putting a heady spin on its subject matter that it consumes itself . a horror film with something to say between shocks is fine . it's rare -- and annoying -- to find one that just won't shut up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
" you never know who anybody is , except me , " susan reassures him . " i am who i am . " well , maybe . you can never be sure in this fascinating labyrinth , written and directed by david mamet in his unique and highly literate style . mamet , whose most recent screenplay was the incredible wag the dog , has given us a host of brilliant pieces of writing , from the more popular ones like the verdict and the untouchables to the even better art house films such as things change and house of games . it is the latter picture that comes closest to the plot and tone of the spanish prisioner , and house of games , being his best film ever , is the one most deserving of inspiring another . more like poetry than prose , the words and the situations of his movies are like impressionist paintings . they make strong statements , but don't attempt a completely realistic approach . this computerless environment is completely divorced from modern reality , and yet works marvelously well in the context of the story . but why ? in a sequence that could serve as a metaphor for the entire story , when one of the japanese tourists speaks , she isn't a tourist after all , but a native texan . she says her few lines with a thick hillbilly accent , . even in picture filled with surprises , this one manages yet again to remind us that things indeed are far from what they seem in the spanish prisoner . it is rated pg for thematic elements including tension , some violent images and brief language and would be fine for kids age 10 and up . 
vincent gardenia and elliott gould who are in the film , were also in the original play . everything is played out in a revue format , as every sketch is done in the form of a scathing farce . the performers were outstanding , as i was especially pleased with marcia rodd's captivating portrayal of someone with spunk . the film was torridly on target and eerily funny , but only to a point , as it seemed to create such a far-out situation , that it was difficult to keep laughing when there was so much cynicism and so much that went beyond the pale of farce and became too arcane to decifer where it was leading to . when elizabeth wilson has the film's last word and says , " you don't know how good it is to hear my family laughing again , " this coming after they acted as snipers , which leaves the black humor with a very tainted message that bears watching . 
hollywood adaptations of plays rarely come off much worse than this b&w one did . there is no kind way to put it otherwise , or to say if only it did this or that the film could have been saved , nor is there reason to say , if the acting was better the film could have been bearable . the problem with the film starts firstly with the casting of the two main actors . whenever they were on screen the film was unwatchable . the first-time actress who was chosen as a result of a national talent search for a newcomer for the part , was won by the iowa teen-ager , jean seberg , who doesn't have whatever inner strength it takes to be joan of arc , at least she doesn't have it at this point of her career , and should have not been cast in that part ; her shrill voice does not make for a naive peasant girl who hears the voice of god , nor does the closing of her eyes portend that she is a visionary . richard widmark , who played the future king charles vii , the dauphin , as if he were jerry lewis in one of those stupid lewis and martin comedies of the 1950s , was not a good casting decision either . he appeared to be ridiculous emoting in his spastic gestures at the camera , as if he was in the wrong film and didn't understand that this one wasn't meant to be a comedy . the story had no emotional appeal or urgent power , and seemed like it was shot by a rank amateur filmmaker who had no idea how to get coherence from a scene and real passion from his performers , in a story that was supposedly all about passion , this one had none . it was an exercise in futility and arrogance on the part of the director , a thumbing his nose at anyone who disagrees that he is a great filmmaker and that he could make any type of film . it is no surprise that there was no audience for this film , that film critics roasted it , and that the ever-arrogant preminger sneered back at them in contempt . but if he wanted to know what joan was all about , he should have observed carl dreyer's masterpiece " the passion of joan of arc " ( 28 ) , and he would have seen the spiritual qualities the story was imbued with and realized that his version had failed to capture the power of the story and why the argument against the church in the story means so much to so many , and for such a long time the story poetically moved a people interested in those who have visions . that scene is my all-time favorite . it was unbelievable . its worth seeing the film just for that . with joan , all high-and-mighty on her steed , shouting out things like , " i get my orders from god , " this film was just too much of a brain-drainer . it was filmmaking at preminger's worst . well , if you're in joan's shoes , and you really believe you're tuned into god , you have no choice but to continue to listen to those voices in your head . what was a great actor like john doing here , and to the bargain , why was he wasted in such a small role ? maybe , if he could have played both joan and king charles this dog would have had legs ! but the film never made it seem like she was anything but a quack , committing herself to a self-imposed death , and she is always seen behaving irrationally . there was no justification for the story's outcome , no power in its presentment , and its style suffered from an ill-humor . preminger , takes a cue from one of the lines in the film , when joan says , " i always know i'm right- because i hear the voices . " 
this is a remake of clouzot's very memorable le corbeau . though not a complete failure , preminger's american version still managed to take most of the starch out of this bitter french chiller and make it seem dull and predictable . even i guessed who was writing the poison letters , and i'm not especially good at that sort of movie detective work . the film changes scenery from its original version in france and now takes place in a small-town near quebec , canada . the film opens by painting onscreen hollywood's idea of what a small-town looks and feels like , as the sun is shining , the mailman is cheerful and nosy , and everything about the town looks picture-perfect . pearson says it's nonsense . but laurent takes a more cautionary approach saying , " you can't dismiss these letters completely , they are written by a psychopath , and they have been known to act against their own interest . " spoiler : if you don't want to know who the poison letter writer is , skip the remainder of the review . the film lost its power and energy to be viewed as a true noir film , and ends up being more like a flat- 'who done it thriller . ' the force of its noir story never fully materialized under preminger's hollywood type of direction . the psychological motives of the couple were too murky to have much intellectual impact on the story . 
screenplay : jeremy leven , based on the novel by steven pressfield . director : robert redford . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , wartime violence ) running time : 125 minutes . philosophy generally makes for godawful cinema . steven pressfield's novel the legend of bagger vance seemed like a terribly unlikely candidate for a film translation , because it wasn't really a novel . combined with a mash note to the game of golf , wrapped loosely around a period narrative . there was no way pressfield's book could be turned into an engaging film . then again , that's what people said about norman maclean's a river runs through it , and somehow director robert redford managed to turn that book into a pretty solid film . but how would a text comprised primarily of mystical lessons and play-by-play from the links be rendered on screen ? redford's adaptation of the legend of bagger vance radically re-imagines pressfield's novel to make it a more palatable screen story . in so doing , he rips out its soul and leaves a fairly bland sports drama in its place . it's easy to see the logic behind most of screenwriter jeremy leven's decisions in adapting bagger vance . the story is streamlined into a tale of redemption and lost love regained , and the climax is rendered as a nigh-mythical clash of titans . it's all quite clean and efficient , with all the prosaic descriptions of transcendentally significant dogleg lefts and most of the revelatory visions left on the page . in fact , it's so clean and efficient that it hardly registers as a drama at all . while pressfield's novel wasn't terribly concerned with making his characters genuinely complex , it didn't really matter contextually . leven and redford don't add much to that complexity , and here it matters a lot . redford is too concerned with making the atmosphere mystical to give junuh's pain an earthly urgency , and matt damon's performance suffers as a result . charlize theron gets to weep a bit , but adele has " romantic interest " written all over her from the outset . will smith does fine , relaxed work as bagger , but his importance as a spiritual teacher is diminished with his teachings reduced to fortune cookie-sized aphorisms . bagger vance was not going to work on the screen with twenty minute sermons on the authentic swing ; it makes perfect sense to shift the focus to the characters . it makes no sense to shift the focus , then still leave the characters underdeveloped . as usual , redford directs a technically accomplished piece of work , beautifully photographed by michael ballhaus and smoothly edited . there's simply no weight to any of it , despite the intrusively heavy score by rachel portman . instead of a meditation on a personal journey to enlightenment told through the unique nature of the game of golf , the film becomes a period piece with a few appealing performances . what remains is a film about whether or not junuh will win the big golf match and/or win the girl . and while it's competently rendered , it's not exactly the matter of cosmic import the film builds it up to be . you can't blame a filmmaker for radically altering a text as inherently uncinematic as the legend of bagger vance . redford , however , alters it to the point that you wonder why he bothered to make it at all . he understood that philosophy generally makes for godawful cinema . he didn't understand that without the philosophy , or rich characterizations to replace it , the legend of bagger vance just barely breaks par . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
187 ( one eight seven ) , the new film from waterworld director kevin reynolds , lies somewhere in the murky gray that separates the exploitation revenge flick from the serious urban drama . simply put , this film is too good to be lumped together with death wish , eye for an eye , and the substitute in the latter genre , but not good enough to share the shelf with boyz 'n the hood and menace ii society . 187 offers some thought-provoking ideas and several effective performances , but the script ultimately lets down both the actors and the audience members who are watching them . public education today isn't what it used to be . so it's not much of a stretch to accept that the environment presented in 187 is closer to reality than to some nightmarish fantasy . almost immediately , his disciplinarian stance makes him a target for the verbal abuse of some of the class' most tough trash-talkers . for better than an hour , 187 treads the delicate line between the gratuitous violence of the substitute and the schmaltz of dangerous minds . in fact , for more than the first half , this movie takes a frank , hard look at the difficulties facing teachers in urban environments today -- how helping a student can be misconstrued , how law suit-fearing administrators are rendered impotent , and how peer pressure can drive otherwise-studious teenagers out of the classroom and into gangs . the last forty-five minutes of 187 play like a condensed , low-key version of falling down . and the conclusion , aside from being unremittingly bleak , is horribly written . the characters' motivations in the climactic scene make no sense whatsoever , and the viewer feels profoundly cheated by events . a saving grace of 187 is the performance of samuel l . jackson , one of today's few " can't miss " actors . no matter how uneven the script , jackson always manages to shine , and , since he's on screen for almost every frame of this film , his forceful screen presence compensates for numerous weaknesses . nevertheless , while jackson's performance is enough to keep us engrossed for most of the running time , even he can't do much with the unfortunate resolution . it's here that 187 comes apart at the seams -- the conclusion will disappoint those who love revenge fantasies and those in search for something more thoughtful . indeed , with a different ending , 187 might have been a truly powerful motion picture . as it is , it has its compelling moments , but , overall , it's flawed and dissatisfying . 
jan hrebejk's divided we fall ( mus ? me si pom ? hat ) , a life is beautiful lite tale , has trouble deciding on its tone . long serious moments are punctuated by whimsical , light-hearted music , suggesting that we should be laughing , although at what isn't apparent . the settings are authentic , but the acting comes across fairly flat . as the credits roll , the movie opens in 1937 in a field in which men are urinating together . this brief scene is aborted in order to skip to another inconsequential episode in 1941 . as the story jumps again to 1943 and the credits are still showing , you being to calculate that the story will end sometime in the twenty-third century . actually , it turns out that the movie is set during the ending of world war ii . the purpose in this bizarre beginning is never quite clear . one supposes that it must have been an attempt at a lightning fast introduction of the characters . the problem with the movie is that too many of the characters seem to have mastered this statuesque lack of expression . the result is a movie that has little impact , save a few nice moments here and there . it is rated pg-13 for some violence and sexual content and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
cast : neal huff , anney giobbe , rik walter , mark douglas , paul mullin , daintry jensen director : david p . moore producers : h . dennis moore , des garrison screenplay : paul mullin cinematography : alfredo padilla david p . moore's debut feature takes place on a college campus where chaos , uncertainty , and racial tension create a turbulent climate . it's only a matter of time before an event , or a series of events , ignites a conflagration . entropy is indeed a theme of hitting the ground , but moore's message is that we should fight against it rather than accepting it as inevitable . by their very nature , college campuses are hotbeds of dramatic potential . some movies , like john singleton's disappointing higher learning , squander the opportunity . others , like hitting the ground , effectively exploit it . there are times when the themes become a little too esoteric , but moore never takes the easy way out . the ending is especially well conceived and executed . other subplots swirl around the main one . as intelligently as hitting the ground deals with most of its issues , it occasionally flounders . although an explanation for the sudden claustrophobia is offered , it's neither convincing nor coherent , and howard's reluctance to enter a building comes across as a plot device rather than a natural psychological reaction to circumstances . he portrays those who work in it as shallow , greedy , and contemptuous of others' intelligence . in moore's view , they're equally soulless . it all has to do with money and power , and there's no room for integrity , truth , or compassion . hitting the ground is far from perfect -- it relies too much on music to establish tone and convey emotion , and some of the performances are uneven . nevertheless , for a first film made on a limited budget , this movie is more perceptive , intelligent , and engrossing than a majority of what emerges from hollywood . 
with a mostly female cast and a poetic title , it might be easy to assume that paradise road is a 1997 version of mike newell's effervescent enchanted april . however , apart from those stated similarities , there's little to connect the two films . paradise road shifts the focus to the lesser-known , but no less inhumane , conditions in the pacific . based on the memoirs of survivors , this movie peels away one more layer of the atrocities associated with the second world war . and the means that the prisoners devise to lift their spirits are , to say the least , unique . yet , even though paradise road is ultimately about the triumph over adversity , the script never forgets that for everyone who overcomes seemingly-impossible obstacles , there are many who stumble along the way , never to rise again . the exceptionally strong cast showcases american , british , and australian actresses , all of whom show an astonishing willingness to appear in physically unflattering circumstances ( no makeup , hair and skin caked with drying mud ) . paradise road is less a tearjerker than an honest examination of the bonds that are formed during extreme situations . although there are some heart-wrenching moments , and several scenes of potentially- disturbing violence , the film never descends to the level of cheap melodrama . instead , it opts for something deeper and more meaningful by allowing us to follow a group of well-rounded characters on a journey with a strong spiritual component . paradise road not only pays tribute to the human will to live , but it is a testament to music's lasting power to heal and uplift . ultimately , paradise road isn't as deeply sad or depressing as a holocaust film , for , although several characters do not survive the movie , the goal of the japanese is punishment and humiliation , not genocide . and , while one of paradise road's themes is the barbarity of war , it manages to present its case without demonizing the japanese ( indeed , it goes to great pains to paint a few of them as sympathetic ) . instead , the film succeeds by humanizing the kinds of survivors who are often pictured as wretched , faceless victims . paradise road owes its existence to writer/director bruce beresford , one of the most inconsistent film makers working today . 
as directed by ted demme and written by mike armstrong , monument ave . concentrates on the texture and the hopelessness of the community that the people feel stuck in . using jump cuts and fast-talking dialog , the movie imparts an immediacy that allows the movie to transcend the lack substantial narrative drive . one of the film's major pitfalls is that the director allows the actors to get sloppy , causing much of the dialog to be lost to low mumbling . and the actors' irish accents wax and wane like the moon . sometimes they are thick and convincing , and other times they mysteriously vanish . a remarkably controlled denis leary plays the lead character bobby o'grady in an ensemble cast . the few times that bobby loses control of the situation are all the more impressive because the usually explosive leary keeps his emotions in check throughout most of the picture . the movie works best in its small moments , which the director gets just right . one scene has the guys arguing over the relative merits of the movies of their generation . elmo's fire is more controversial . like members trapped in a religious cult , charlestown's inhabitants have no idea that leaving is even an option . the tragedy of their situation isn't what happens , but what doesn't or , at least in their view , what can't . monument ave . it is not rated but would be an r for violence , profanity , and pervasive hard drug usage and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature . 
after flaming out spectacularly in its last few attempts at feature animation -- gems like quest for camelot and the king and i -- warner bros . finally figured out how to guarantee a decent story : they re-made e . t . as a cartoon . technically , of course , that's not what the iron man is . on a fairly superficial level , the iron man is a cold war allegory about paranoia turned against anything unfamiliar . screenwriter tim mccanlies and director brad bird drop in little tidbits of period detail -- hogarth's fascination with radiation/mutation films , his friendship with a beatnik scrapyard owner/artist ( harry connick jr . ) -- but they don't really take full advantage of their setting . the decision to set the film in 1957 maine seems fairly arbitrary , especially since hughes' book was not . a bit more successful is the thematic treatment of the giant as a weapon that learns how to be human . some viewers may shift in their seats at the " guns kill " message-mongering , but it's intriguing to see a family film tackling the notion of a sentient being accepting responsibility for its own moral choices , and finding heroism in the process . the iron giant ultimately does prove entertaining not because of its astute observations about 1950s america or gun control , but because it's a classic " boy and his dog " story -- e . t . the set-ups are familiar , but familiarity doesn't have to mean laziness . as directed by " the simpsons " and " king of the hill " veteran bird , the iron giant has a slightly subversive sense of humor and a lively pace , giving the oft-told tale its own unique spice . it's e . t . -lite , to be sure , but it still pushes the right buttons . on a technical level , the iron giant may not dazzle like some recent disney features . while the integration of the digitally-created giant and the conventionally-drawn characters is seamless , the backgrounds come out a bit flat and the colors somewhat muted . yet the toned-down animation may actually work to the iron giant's advantage . there's more innocence to the character design , more simple charm in the laid-back direction . i'm not sure the iron giant earns the big emotional crescendo it's looking for when hogarth finally stares skyward at the giant and says " i love you , " but the fundamental appeal of the relationship between a lonely boy and his alien puppy is always in effect . if it's true that there are no new stories to tell , the success of a film is always about the time the filmmakers invest in telling the old stories well . so e . t . you'll still probably be pulling for him to turn on his heartlight . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
" hey daddy , what are you doing ? " the star of the film is a highly likable but completely crazy sean penn as eddie , jeanie's father . although the rape happens off camera and the scene cuts away quickly , it is one of several parts of the film that can be hard to take . " can you sew ? can you dance ? what can you do ? " nick cassavetes , whose unhook the stars earlier this year was beautiful and uplifting , at least knows how to stage scenes well in this disquieting film . the scene seems about as unbelievable as the rest of the film , but visually it certainly shocks the audience into paying attention . although the people in the film drink and smoke constantly , maureen gives the impression that she mainlines caffeine as well . the show has such excellent actors as harry dean stanton , debi mazar , sally kellerman , james gandolfini , and gena rowlands in the minor roles . although all the actors accomplish what they set out to do , only sean penn gives an exceptional performance . still , you have to ask yourself if these are people you want to spend a couple of hours with . you may feel the same way when the ending credits release you from your time with these unhappy alcoholics . she's so lovely runs 1 : 52 . the show would be acceptable only for the most mature teenagers . i admired the performances but did not like the film enough to recommend it . i give it * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
abbas kiarostami's brilliantly perceptive film is based on a true story , but is done in mock-documentary style . this slow-moving , temperately structured film , shot in the cin ? ma-v ? rit ? style so that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between what is real and what is reconstructed , has a curious fascination about it . he just reads books on film and has never worked on one before , but always wanted to be a director . he also looks somewhat like the director , but not enough to fool anyone who has ever seen what the director looks like . the film has a somewhat curious aesthetic feel to it , as the director's motivations seem to be largely a test for the audience to see if they really know what they are getting from their experience in viewing a film . all those who testify , tell the truth from their own viewpoint , as some of the dialogue is pleasingly witty and some of the observations made are extremely sharp . at the film's conclusion , kiarostami wants to make sure that we know it is only a film , as he has the pardoned sabzian return with flowers to the home of mr . ahankhah . the director forces us to be alerted that what we are seeing is not real life , and that it is made possible only through technology . he is not a criminal in the sense of what we think a criminal is , and this compelling film lets us think of him in whatever way we want to , as we watch this film as viewer , judge , and jury . the marvelous thing , is that kiarostami can get superb performances from the non-professional actors as well as the professionals , because as sabzian stated during the trial , acting is just being yourself , letting it all come out from the heart . this is just a wonderful film , with kiarostami's humor prevailing . it is also an interesting look at modern iran , its bureaucracy , its class divisions , its high unemployment , and its seemingly fair-minded court system . 
although the films were often easy to dismiss , the actress' consistently fine performances were not . finally , with the ice storm , ricci was given a role of import in a film of substance . ricci's performance is only one reason why don roos' the opposite of sex is a success . this is perhaps the most audacious film of the year to date ( at least among mainstream releases ) , filling the slot left vacant by 1997's in the company of men . the opposite of sex is the kind of daring feature that doesn't open every friday at the local multiplex ; its frank , sometimes politically incorrect approach towards the act and politics of sex is refreshing . and , in addition to dealing with intrinsically provocative material , first-time director roos uses the unique approach of satirizing the conventions of road pictures and dysfunctional family dramas to tell his story . in particular , he has a lot of fun with the voice-over . the glib narrator , deedee truitt ( ricci ) , is aware that she's speaking to a movie audience , and , as a result , can't resist the opportunity to have some fun at the viewer's expense . in her opening monologue , she informs us that " things get very complicated very quick , and you're going to have trouble getting through it without me talking , " then , in case we mistake her for a cute-but- misunderstood 16-year old , she warns us that " i don't have a heart of gold and i don't grow one later . " at another time , she " shows " scenes of things that don't really happen , then laughs at our gullibility for believing them . although deedee is the narrator and , consequently , has the largest speaking part , she's not the film's central character . as comedies go , the opposite of sex is one of 1998's most consistently funny . of course , humor is subjective , and i'm known for being a little warped in that area , so roos' flamboyant , out-on-a-limb approach is perfect for someone like me . the dialogue is crisp and distinctive , occasionally invoking the spirit of something written by kevin smith ( clerks , chasing amy ) . however , it's obvious to roos ( and to us ) that this kind of slick , unconventional style can have trouble sustaining a feature-length movie . no matter how outrageous the tone , it grows tiresome after a while , so the writer/director changes gears during the second half . although the opposite of sex never completely loses its satirical , self-mocking edge , the final 50 minutes are more serious than what precedes them , and the humor is leavened by a couple of earnest , surprisingly-effective messages . one particularly intriguing concept is carl's assertion that maybe sex isn't for recreation or procreation , but for concentration ? that when a man and woman sleep together , the experience attunes them to each other . this is in contrast with deedee's largely-negative view of sex . while ricci's performance in the opposite of sex is the standout , it's not the most surprising example of acting , at least when one considers her previous critical acclaim . lucia proves that kudrow has a rarely-displayed range . so , with ricci and kudrow leading the way , the women in the opposite of sex are far more interesting than the men . martin donovan underplays bill as smart , affable , and bland . ivan sergei plays matt as dumb , affable , and bland . and lyle lovett portrays carl as strange , affable , and bland . the tag line for the opposite of sex is : " you'll laugh , you'll cry , you'll be offended . " while that's perhaps overstating the movie's impact , it's not completely off-base . the film manages to mix a portion of successful drama into its primarily-comic foundation , and conservative movie-goers will likely be turned off by the no-punches pulled , occasionally raunchy look at sex . however , with its memorable dialogue , solid performances , and idiosyncratic style , the opposite of sex is sure to be appreciated by those who aren't frightened away by the cinematic equivalent of hot chili . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
" the environmental movement of our times was sparked by the re-release of bambi in the 1950s , " is one of many deliciously offbeat slices of wisdom from writer and director wilt stillman's latest film , the last days of disco . full of wry , intelligent humor , stillman's pictures ( metropolitan and barcelona ) are perhaps an acquired taste , and his latest is arguably his best yet . we are told that the story is set in " the very early 1980s , " and , although it is being marketed as a nostalgic disco movie , the story really has little to do with discos or dancing . the movie is a talkfest that uses the disco scene and the period merely as a backdrop . forget those guys and their hang-ups . the film comes alive with its wonderfully complex , intellectual humor that is so dense and fast-paced that it might take several viewings to catch it all . one long scene has the group deconstructing the meaning of lady and the tramp , contemplating the various dogs' psychological motivations and envisioning possible epilogues . " to thine own self be true " can become bad advice if your " self " isn't all that great in the first place . besides , it could be worse since vd is easily treatable , unlike herpes . much of their logic has an escher quality , nicely twisting back on itself . des , who turns out to be the most interesting character of all , is full of reflections on life . " we're really designed for pairing off . " " i wanted you to know that i'm not one of them . i can be discouraged . " it is rated r for brief scenes of sex , nudity , and drug usage and would be fine for older teenagers . 
even at his most vicious , stewart maintains a debonair style and sly wit that automatically make his villains more interesting than the run-of-the-mill sort . unfortunately , in masterminds , the distinguished actor is literally the only worthwhile piece of flotsam bobbing around on a sea of hackneyed sewage . masterminds is bad . unfortunately , it's not bad in a freespirited , campy sense -- it's bad in a way that makes it painful to endure . this is one of those motion pictures where i found myself looking at my watch with increasing regularity , wondering about the virtues of walking out on the film , and praying that the projectionist would accidentally leave out a reel or two . ( plot-wise , such an omission wouldn't have mattered -- the movie is so obvious that it would have been simple to guess what was missing . ) director roger christian , whose resume highlights several virtually-unknown features , is obviously a big fan of die hard , since this film is the most blatant rip-off i've seen , right down to all the little plot devices ( like the walkie-talkie communication with an ally on the outside ) . in fact , christian and screenwriter floyd byars are so aware that they're stealing from die hard that they even include a line to that effect ( " we have a die hard situation here ! " ) . actually , it's possible to re-use the die hard material effectively ; my complaint with masterminds is that it manages to ruin things at every turn . instead of this being a pulse-pounding rollercoaster ride of adrenaline , it's a pointless bore . everything that was special about die hard has been negated here by careless writing , bad acting , and pedestrian direction . aside from stewart , the only thing that kept me interested was trying to figure out what kind of bizarre accent brenda fricker uses . as far as i can tell , there are three rules that must be followed for any action film to attain a degree of success . the first is that the movie must maintain some level of credibility ; this film gives new meaning to the term preposterous ( for example , no one gets hurt or even seriously injured , despite numerous explosions and one electrocution ) . second , the action must be exciting and there must be a sense that the protagonist's life is in danger . nothing could be further from the truth here , where the big scenes are just excuses to blow things up . finally , and most importantly , it's necessary for the audience to develop a rapport with the main character . in masterminds , that's difficult , if not impossible , because ozzie is such a snot . as the movie progressed , i kept hoping he would get shot or crushed or incinerated . i never liked him , and if there's any reason to root for raif , it's because he has such an obnoxious opponent . kartheiser , who was last seen in alaska , has mastered the ability to really annoy a viewer . masterminds represents the pinnacle of action movie tediousness , the kind of film that makes me yearn for mediocrity . by comparison , the moribund speed 2 zipped along at a breakneck pace . this film appears to have been written by a member of the target audience , and possesses a grade-school intelligence level ( ironic , considering the title ) . that way , there will be no need to entertain thoughts of a sequel -- something that the final scene clearly has in mind . " the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . .

cast : bruce willis , madeleine stowe , brad pitt , christopher plummer , david morse director : terry gilliam producer : charles roven screenplay : david peoples and janet peoples , inspired by la jetee cinematography : roger pratt music : paul buckmaster u . s . distributor : universal pictures any film that enters the realm of time travel does so at its own peril . you need look no further than last year's disastrous timecop to understand why . thus , it's a refreshing to encounter a movie with a logical , intelligent approach to the dangers of zipping through time . while i won't claim that twelve monkeys has a decisive solution ( how can anything be " decisive " when it's so firmly grounded in fantasy ? ) , this approach makes sense , primarily because the time trippers here aren't trying to change the past ( hence , wiping out reality ) , but are instead observing it to make a better future . as it is , though , that future looks pretty bleak . it's a chilling , almost gothic , sequence that perfectly establishes the film's dark mood . like director terry gilliam's previous efforts brazil and time bandits , this movie is saturated with atmosphere . the grim , gray film has two tones : somber and apocalyptic . those in search of feel good escapism would do better to check out mr . holland's opus . for the most part , twelve monkeys is a maze of plot twists and turns . yet , despite all the hiccuping through time , the story is neither exceptionally obtuse nor hard to follow . in fact , it's possible to make shrewd guesses about some of what's going to happen . even a movie as complex as this doesn't want to lose its audience along the way -- at least not for too long . one of the most unsettling aspects of twelve monkeys is that the story is told from the perspective of an unreliable narrator , even though it's ostensibly third-person point-of-view . there are multiple interpretations for the entire picture . it can be viewed as a somewhat atypical science fiction adventure , a black comedy/social commentary , the paranoid nightmares of a deluded madman , or some combination of all three . it's up to each individual to determine which is the most likely " truth " , and this storyline ambiguity , more than anything else , makes twelve monkeys a consistently engaging motion picture . although the movie as a whole is open to interpretation , certain elements of gilliam's film are straightforward . twelve monkeys uses a rapier-sharp wit to skewer both sides of the animal rights' movement , as well as the general conscience of society . the scenes of wild animals running amok might recall jumanji to some , but gilliam's sense of style makes for more startling and lasting images . if anything , these sequences underline the ephemeral nature of humanity's supremacy on this planet . while script , settings , and production design are obvious strengths of twelve monkeys , acting is not . bruce willis and madeleine stowe are adequate ( and , at times , perhaps a little moreso ) , but neither does anything noteworthy here . brad pitt gives a deliciously over-the-top performance that , while derivative of jack nicholson's more memorable roles , is nevertheless enjoyable -- enjoyable , but not superlative . supporting players like christopher plummer and david morse ( who outacted nicholson in the crossing guard ) are hardly worth mentioning . while each motion picture maintains its own identity , there are numerous similarities , the most obvious being a darkly twisted view of an apocalyptic future . the films compliment each other , and it's plain that the directors have precise visions that are effectively , and sometimes spectacularly , realized . best of all , both movies challenge the mind -- something that too few productions can be accused of these days . 
warriors of virtue is a great title . unfortunately , it's not a great movie . the film , a family-oriented fantasy-adventure , is an amalgamation of asian mysticism , cartoon violence , j . r . r . for originality , coherence , and intelligence , it's on par with stargate and independence day . for entertainment , it's a notch below . the film opens with an ominous , disembodied voice declaring , " i remember a world with no wars , no warriors . the basic story is a variation on the age-old struggle between good and evil , although , in warriors of virtue , it's heavily leavened with mystical and anti-violence messages . the latter seem rather hypocritical , for , although the film hammers home the moral that killing is evil , it doesn't have a problem with the concept of applying a vicious beating to a foe . the kung fu battle sequences , while choreographed with flair , are often brutal , and the lack of blood only makes them seem more sanitized . warriors of virtue is a little to juvenile to be enjoyable for anyone past puberty . the film , with its shallow symbols ( such as a cocoon in a jar ) and sermonizing , displays little thematic or character depth . the plot is perfunctory and obvious , and the special effects used to animate the five partially-animatronic warriors are barely adequate . the set design is impressive , but that doesn't mean much amidst all the other woes . for good measure , a healthy dose of pop chinese mysticism is injected into the script . the movie's most interesting character , a girl named alyssia ( marley shelton ) , is criminally underused . she's the only one in the film that we develop any real interest in , and the script , apparently unable to deal with a personality having the potential to display more than one dimension , discards her perfunctorily and inelegantly . the acting in warriors of virtue can be counted among its most serious flaws . director ronnie yu ( the bride with white hair ) , one of many hong kong film makers migrating to the west , has an excellent visual sense , but , at least in this case , he is incapable of culling solid performances out of his cast members . yedidia's " performance " makes you appreciate the quality evident in the work of his many superior peers . angus macfadyen ( robert the bruce in braveheart ) is distinctly unimpressive , with a generic , over-the-top style that's more laughable than effective . there's nothing remotely sinister about komodo -- he looks like a rock star in need of a good night's sleep . marley shelton and chao-li chi are merely adequate in supporting parts . i suppose the five actors trapped beneath the warrior costumes deserve some kind of recognition for what they endured to lend their creature-characters a semblance of life . fantasy films have an extremely poor motion picture history , perhaps because it's so difficult for a movie to capture the kind of pure magic that exists only in the imagination . warriors of virtue is an abysmal entry to the genre , and boasts very little to offer any audience , young or old . the film makers probably thought they were creating a sort of wizard of oz for today's generation . 
apparently , it isn't enough for a plague to be the villain . the problem with outbreak is that extraneous plot elements like donald sutherland's general , a couple of aerial chases , and an unbelievably contrived search for a monkey , keep getting in the way of a chilling horror story . in this film , we're given tantalizing glimpses of that scenario , but the need to interject action and adventure for a momentary thrill robs outbreak of dramatic power . yes , this movie is an entertaining and sometimes wildly-exhilarating ride . the helicopter chase sequence is thrilling--only it doesn't seem to belong here . and , when the movie is over , any more-than-cursory consideration of the plot reveals gaps that even sizable doses of coincidence and contrivance can't completely fill . outbreak is not one of those pictures that improves in retrospect . but in 1995 , it shows up again , only this time it's not restricted to africa . as directed by accomplished film maker wolfgang petersen ( in the line of fire , das boot ) , outbreak is a beautifully photographed , competently-acted piece . dustin hoffman is carefully contained as daniels , never straying over the top . cuba gooding jr . gives a stable , if sometimes cliched performance , as the " sidekick . " freeman and russo are solid in supporting roles . only sutherland , sporting an american accent , can't avoid chewing on the scenery . his portrayal , like his character , would be more at home in dr . strangelove than here , and it's a sore spot that the movie never quite recovers from . most viewers are likely to enjoy outbreak , especially coming as it does in the midst of a veritable wasteland of general release pictures . it's an escapist thriller with good guys to root for and bad guys to hiss at . yet the source of lamentation is not what's on screen , but what could have been there . no one likes to be teased , but that's exactly what this movie does to us , with predictably frustrating results . fluff--especially the variety with a lot of flashes and bangs--often makes for perfect light entertainment , except when , as in the case of outbreak , it starts out with the promise of so much more . . . a promise that is never fulfilled on a higher-than-superficial level .

united states , 1997 ( original 1980 ) release date : 5/21/80 ( wide ) special edition release date : 2/21/97 ( wide ) running length ( special edition ) : 2 : 06 mpaa classification : pg ( mild violence ) theatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 indulge me for a moment as i time travel back to 1980 . but , for science fiction movie lovers , there was only one event : the may 21 opening of the empire strikes back . the movie was a guaranteed success before its first public show . although it lacks the pioneering " newness " of star wars , the empire strikes back is in many ways a superior motion picture . the storyline is more interesting and ambitious , the characters -- little more than appealing types in the original -- are allowed to grow and develop , the special effects are more mature , and the tone is deliciously dark and downbeat . it's the latter quality that has made the empire strikes back the least favorite among young star wars fans -- excepting yoda , there's nothing cute to be found , and the film definitely doesn't leave viewers with a warm , fuzzy feeling . in the first film , good triumphed decisively over evil ; here , it's almost the other way around . for the special edition , lucas has chosen to do considerably less re-engineering than he did with star wars , which is evidence that empire , as originally presented , was close to his vision . the soundtrack has been digitally beefed up , a few new scenes have been inserted ( including some extended shots of the wampa ice creature's attack ) , and certain effects sequences have been noticably enhanced ( the millenium falcon's approach to the cloud city being the most obvious ) . in general , however , the changes to empire are less obvious than those to star wars , which were subtle enough in their own right . there's nothing in the special edition that changes the scope , quality , or intent of the film . it's a little bigger , a little brighter , and a little louder . the movie does not pick up where star wars left off . in terms of the mythological antecedents that lucas based much of his star wars trilogy on , there was nothing startling about vader's origins , but , considering the darkness it would inevitably inject into the series , it was a bold stroke . the scenes that begin with the luke/vader lightsaber duel and end with the young hero's despairing decision to allow himself to plummet out of vader's reach represent the most compelling sequence offered by any of the three movies . the structure of the empire strikes back is more complex than the relatively linear path traversed by star wars . instead of keeping the heroes together , as was the case in the first film , lucas , along with director irvin kershner and screenwriters leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan , elects to split them up . everything comes together at the end , and there's a reunion of sorts , but the empire strikes back concludes with so many unanswered questions that it's tantamount to a cliffhanger . all of the primary actors are more relaxed here than in star wars . harrison ford , easily the most successful of the three leads outside of star wars , shows obvious improvement , honing his cynical-but-lovable performance to a fine edge . the visual effects in the empire strikes back are far more impressive than those of star wars . from the approach of the imposing imperial walkers to the escape from the cloud city , there's a lot here to delight the eye . likewise , john williams' score , which uses multiple cues from star wars , displays the richness and maturity necessary for a darker , more operatic motion picture . because of the high quality of the original product , it doesn't show a hint of dating . neither the first nor the third chapters ( or , properly , the " fourth " and " sixth " ) of the star wars saga were able to match the narrative scope of empire , which today remains one of the finest and most rousing science fiction tales ever committed to the screen . 
described by some as an iranian woody allen , farmanara is more of a poignantly tragic comedian . with its references to poe and dickens , this slice of the end of a man's life strikes universal themes . as you might guess , the film has certain autobiographical elements in that farmanara was himself kept for 20 years from making films . the film is in persian with english subtitles . it is not rated but might be pg for mature themes . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
howdy , pardner . saddle on up , and join me on a little ride . and , along the way , if you spy a theater showing this new woody harrelson/kiefer sutherland flick , the cowboy way , just keep goin' . it ain't worth the bother of stabling the horse . well , perhaps that's a little cruel , but this movie really isn't a whole lot better--or fundamentally a whole lot different--from eddie murphy's recent beverly hills cop iii blunder . both pictures try to mix action and comedy , and end up doing neither well . perhaps someone this summer will come out with a picture that's both exciting and funny , but it hasn't happened yet . the real enjoyment of any " fish out of water " motion picture comes from watching the lead characters react and adapt to the unusual setting . this is what made crocodile dundee and star trek iv : the voyage home such fun experiences . add violence and traditional bad guys , and you get the dundee sequel , which was , at best , a huge disappointment . the cowboy way not only has the guns and crooks , but long chase scenes as well . one of the chief problems with the cowboy way is that it spends so little effort detailing the characters' reactions to their circumstances and so much time attempting to craft a thriller . there are a lot more punches than punchlines , and the feeble comedy quickly takes a back seat to all sorts of action-based genre staples . the plot is exceptionally thin ( not to mention dumb ) , and obviously had to be padded out to feature film length . as a result , there are a number of pointless scenes that serve no purpose other than to eat up running time . woody harrelson doesn't really act his part . kiefer sutherland is more relaxed and natural , but his laid-back portrayal gives his co-star too much of the spotlight . dylan mcdermott plays the head villain with a typical bad guy attitude that's supposed to make the audience hate him . the only supporting performer worth mentioning is cara buono , who makes a convincing damsel in distress . too bad her role wasn't slightly more meaty . the cowboy way is just another in a long line of summer motion pictures that hopefully won't amount to much at the box office or elsewhere . as far as i'm concerned , these guys should ride off into the sunset and forget coming back for anything--especially a sequel . 
the full monty is the third recent dramatic comedy to emerge from the united kingdom to illustrate the effects of unemployment on the individual and the family . like brassed off ! moreso than its two immediate predecessors , however , the full monty is interested in getting the audience to leave the theater with a warm feeling , and , considering this undemanding agenda , it's reasonably successful . no one would ever call the full monty ambitious . in fact , with its confident reliance upon formulaic situations and familiar characters , it's anything but that . most of the credit for the film's success must go to the game troupe of actors and director peter cattaneo , who allows the story to develop in an unforced , easygoing manner . originality may be at a premium here , but the full monty offers plenty of opportunities for laughter and genial smiles . the tremendous crowds that turn out for the event give gaz an idea . if male strippers who don't take it all off can rake in the money , what about those who are willing to show " the full monty " ? unlike other recent stripper movies ( showgirls and striptease , for example ) , the full monty throws pretended eroticism out the window . there isn't a sexually provocative moment in the film . the nudity is discretely handled , although the actors did in fact perform a live strip show in front of 400 extras in a sequence that was , according to the director , " a one-take deal . " this lends a degree of spontaneity to the full monty that makes the movie's climactic scenes more believable and enjoyable . the degree to which the actors manage to bring their characters to life is a key reason why the full monty is a little better than countless other pictures with similar goals . robert carlyle plays gaz with the right mix of pathos and energy . the actor continues to impress with his range , adding this film to an impressive resume that includes ken loach's riff-raff , michael winterbottom's go now , and the aforementioned trainspotting . tom wilkinson ( sense and sensibility ) has the " stuck up bastard with a good heart " role down pat . and , as the overweight dave , mark addy brings to the fore feelings of insecurity that almost anyone can relate to . the full monty is basically about overcoming adversity and succeeding is spite of certain perceived shortcomings ( no pun intended ) . cattaneo borrows a tactic that numerous , recent australian comedies have adopted : incorporating a slew of pop hits into the soundtrack . what the full monty lacks in depth , it makes up for in good will and likeability . this isn't a great movie , but it's breezy , enjoyable , and easy to sit through . and sometimes , even when dealing with a serious issue like unemployment , that can be the perfect tone to drive home a message . 
just as it is most assuredly determined from birth whether one will like liver or not , so it is with actors and costume dramas . casting her as the female lead in a film version of another henry james novel , " washington square , " a role that won an oscar for olivia de havilland in 1949 , represents significant risk for washington square's director agnieszka holland . as in her most recent performance in a thousand acres , she makes a strategic error in washington square and underplays her part . all of the above notwithstanding , her performance , which remains central to the enjoyment of the film , is delightful even if sometimes strained . czech director holland approaches each film with a passion for detail . after catherine's mother has died in childbirth , the director manages to wait until the baby playing catherine has such a remarkably wise and soulful look that one feels the baby understands the tragedy . ( for the record , fat people can become and stay thin ones -- i , for one , did -- but it is not likely , and the story creates a visual discord by not explaining the transformation . ) catherine's costumes by anna sheppard , academy award nominee for schindler's list , make catherine look exceedingly plain and gawky . it is . morris , played with charm and panache by ben chaplin from the truth about cats & dogs , becomes the story's enigma . smith's delicate performance engenders a wave of giggles in the audience whenever she opens her mouth . " you'll have to excuse me , mr . townsend , " she explains . " i have a fortuitous headache . " jan a . p . kaczmarek's heavy violin music is as rich as the paneled rooms in which much of the action takes place . the lovely federalist houses there dot a richly textured urban landscape . when catherine's knees buckle from her first kiss by morris , her first beau , leigh manages to make it believable . never had the ungainly catherine expected such rapture . in a time of r-rated show-'em-everything sexuality , it is refreshing to visit a time when more was not necessarily better , and when a kiss was , well , a kiss . chapin's performance is as dead-on as finney's . " it is a perfectly fitting conclusion , " says catherine as the story begins to wrap up . " i like it very much .

" it's always in fashion to take a stab at the shallow white underbelly of tinseltowners , but hurlyburly -- adapted by david rabe from his play -- offers more than cheap shot industry-bashing . at its heart it's a study of a man who has set himself up for perpetual disappointment by being tempermentally incompatible with the people who surround him . it's a riveting performance as one of the best-written characters of the year . david rabe's writing has the familiar rhythm of another playwright named david -- mamet -- giving the dialogue the snap of exchanged gunfire . hurlyburly always feels like a film adaptation of a stage play , with the action centered at all times on character interaction , which is not to say that it's static or visually uncompelling . this is certainly a piece for actors above all , with a uniformly stellar cast -- be prepared to be surprised by meg ryan in a small role as a stripper -- but it's not a film where the camera sets up simply for people to deliver monologues . hurlyburly feels like its setting : smooth and slick , with something dark bubbling just underneath . it's easy to get caught up in one element of a film's tone , particularly if previous films on a similar subject have led you to expect that sort of tone . yes , hurlyburly is dark -- there are unhappy people who spend most of their time swearing , snorting or debasing other unhappy people , there is violence , and there is death . there are moments of raw emotion that come from unexpected places and take unexpected forms . and there is the hope that a man can remember how to care . those who see this as just another nihilistic stroll down hollywood boulevard aren't looking closely enough . hurlyburly may be talky , but the talk isn't cheap . that shallow white underbelly has rarely run this deep . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
" tea with mussolini " is based on the semiautobiography of the film's director and co-screenwriter franco zeffirelli . these english expatriates feel very comfortable to be in italy , excited by the civilizing nature of all the art around them . because of her biting tongue , she is known as the i scorpioni , a name that unfairly sticks to this gaggle of english ladies , since lady hester seems to be the only one with acid on her tongue . lily tomlin is the american in the group , a bold lesbian archeologist , in a role that is inconsequential , she doesn't even have any funny lines , but she's always smiling , dressed in pants , and sunburned ( the reason for her being so happy , is that she is probably daydreaming about some of the better films she has been in ) . she has the most embarrassing line in the film , as she explains to luca why she remains in italy , " i have warmed both hands before the fires of michelangelo and botticelli . " lady hester sets the tone and proper standards for how this snooty group behaves . the film ends on a melodramatic note , and if this wasn't supposed to be a true story , it would be one that was hard to fathom . this was a ridiculous movie ; it was an apathetic sudser with flat dialogue , stiff characterizations , and if it didn't take place in florence , where art is a way of life , this film would be a feckless fiasco . it is hard to believe that luca is franco zeffirelli , he seemed so out of it , the role seemed to have nothing to say , as if he wasn't there when he was there , and his heroics as a 17-year-old with the resistance movement seemed unconvincing . also , the actor who played him , baird wallace , was very stiff and made his presence felt in a very awkward manner . since the film is supposedly about the director blossoming to become a great artist , i saw no evidence of this . this is a fourth-rate production . 
watch how menacing robert walker can make bruno with nothing more that a devious smile and a box of popcorn he munches nonchalantly . miriam , played like a oversexed schoolgirl by laura elliot , is pregnant but probably not with guy's baby . hitchcock is a master at setting up scenes for maximum effect . and when the camera moves to outside its entrance , we hear a scream from inside , which turns out to be nothing more than miriam yelling at one of her boyfriends with an " oh , stop that , " meaning don't do anything of the kind . in another beautifully composed sequence miriam's glasses fall off when bruno begins to strangle her . ten minutes into the film . but not to worry , guy has a rock solid alibi . hitchcock's characters , as usual , feature an everyman , guy in this movie , wrapped up in a web he has trouble breaking . hitchcock has a deft touch with his actors producing characters in predicaments that are easy to empathize with . as guy gets swept up in the story's whirlpool , hitchcock uses some classic and always effective thriller backdrops such an amusement park . more imaginative is setting up a tennis match that doesn't look like it will end soon enough as a way to ratchet up the tension . and , finally , a run-away merry-go-round provides the film's piece de resistance vehicle for terror . it is rated pg for violence and tension and would be fine for kids around nine and up . 
crime wave ( director : andr ? de toth ; screenwriters : from a story by john & ward hawkins/crane wilbur/bernard gordon/richard e . wormser ; cinematographer : bert glennon ; editor : thomas reilly ; cast : sterling hayden ( lt . it is noteworthy for its great b&w location shots of the busy l . a . streets and of capturing a noir look of alienation . andr ? de toth only directed one other noir film , pitfall ( 48 ) . one of the film's pleasures is in the offhand gestures it makes to sim's quirks . this low-budget b-flick was very entertaining . it has a fast-pace , a good eye for detail , and some vivid camera shots around los angeles , which made for a tough looking film . 
dalloway , an adaptation of virginia woolf's classic novel . because of its strong leading character and female-oriented themes , it's easy to understand why the film held such appeal for an avowed feminist like gorris . in conjunction with vanessa redgrave , the director paints a probing-but-flawed portrait of a thoughtful woman . redgrave , who brings depth and a sense of poignant longing to clarissa dalloway , was instrumental in getting this picture made . dalloway , and suggested to screenwriter eileen atkins that it would make a good movie . the point of the film isn't to debate whether she made the right or wrong decision , but to emphasize that everyone has roads not taken . dalloway is that it manages to effectively capture the poignancy and wistful yearning of gazing back through the years at what was and what might have been . clarissa's bittersweet reminiscences are so powerfully-presented that they will strike a responsive with many viewers . i left the film contemplating the undeniable truth of how quickly ( and sometimes cruelly ) time passes everyone by . graves plays the part effectively , and the story of the young man's loss of identity is tragic , but i found the warren-smith scenes to be more of a distraction than a crucial subplot . not surprisingly , the acting is top-notch . redgrave shines , whether she's gazing back through the mists of the past or , in the film's best sequence , making pithy asides to expose the true nature of the guests at her party . mrs . dalloway will probably appeal most strongly to those who appreciate merchant-ivory's unhurried pace . the story , which is more of a character study than a plot-oriented narrative , moves slowly and deliberately , giving us a crystal-clear picture of the many faces of clarissa dalloway -- who she was , who she might have been , and who she has become . - ingmar bergman 
this is fundamentally a feminist oriented road movie without the politics of the movement playing a part in the story , as the film is steeped in personal irony over abandonment of loved ones and fantasies that can't become real , without any particular message to deliver , except that these two have their hands full coping with their life , as it seems , it is only by their humor and forceful spirit that they can manage to survive . since they consider themselves artists , they feel their act speaks for itself and are particularly upset at being blind sided by one hostile viewer of their show , an overweight lady who feels that they made fun of how obese women look in their act and she felt they did a disservice to women who have that problem , as she upsets them as she rails at them before walking out . since the family treats him as someone not to be taken seriously , yet it is quite evident , that he , alone , has a real love for something that the bourgeois in his family just don't have . a chocolate salesman tells them every one is an actor trying to sell their product , but the important thing is , if you try hard enough people will forgive you for what you are lacking or might not even notice it . that his gimmick is to get the children to eat the chocolate first , then the parents are delighted that the kids like the chocolate , so his sale becomes an easy one . though , what stands out , is the marvelously genuine performances of the heroines of the story and how appealing they were in such a troublesome way , that there public appearance might seem calm and collected , but behind the scenes they are being gnawed at by all the chaos in their life . this thought provoking film , touched many different themes with equal breath and veracity , but this also highlighted its most glaring weakness , that it couldn't focus in on any one theme completely , as it mostly questioned middle-class values and the need for a person to find a way to express themselves enthusiastically , pointing out that maybe , that is all one can hope for , yet leaving so many other things unanswered that it brought up , that you could write your own movie from all that was left unsaid that remains speculative about the girls and their situation . 
- mike figgis , director of the browning version call it merchant/ivory lite . in fact , the browning version has more than superficial similarities to last year's the remains of the day . the title refers to robert browning's translation of aeschylus' agememnon , a story which has both symbolic and concrete significance to the film's plot . the browning version does not lack substance , but it is somnolently-paced and goes virtually nowhere . much of the character interaction is shallow and perfunctory , and almost all the subplots not directly connected with the main story are unappealing . jean francois robin's exemplary camera work can't hide the script's basic deficiencies . his is a performance to laud , even though it has no chance of a deserved oscar nomination ( too few people will see the browning version ) . like anthony hopkins in the remains of the day , finney perfectly captures the frustrating essence of a repressed man with all of his pent-up emotion bubbling just beneath the surface . we in the audience have an irrational urge to shake andrew until he acts . greta scacchi is solid , although vastly overshadowed by her co-star . unfortunately , the rest of the cast isn't as eye-opening . matthew modine is the personification of blandness and the venerable michael gambon is far from stellar as a stereotypical doddering headmaster . julian sands , in a small role as andrew's replacement , is ineffectual enough to blend with the scenery . figgis is adept in fashioning several heartwrenching moments during the browning version , all of which are lent their potency through the strength of finney's acting . the climactic speech , which is meant to be cathartic , verges on a scent of a woman-like overkill . figgis and finney , however , manage to keep things barely on the right side of the " cornball " line , allowing the scene to accomplish what is intended . though set in the 1990s , the browning version has the feel of a period piece . without albert finney , no amount of upper class british posturing would have made a difference to the final product . with him , however , we are treated to a rare example of transcendent characterization--an individual who can make a mediocre motion picture worth a look . 
a simple wish falls into the category occupied by dozens of other recent family features that share a few traits -- they're innocuous , mediocre , and thoroughly forgettable . the movie , directed by michael ritchie ( the bad news bears , fletch ) from a script by jeff rothberg , isn't bad per se , but it's the kind of production where nothing sticks in the mind once you've exited the theater . inept films linger like a bad taste and good movies bathe the viewer in a pleasant afterglow , but a simple wish's feeble impression vanishes the moment that there's something marginally interesting to captivate the attention ( like looking both ways before crossing the street ) . the best thing about a simple wish is young actress mara wilson , who despite being noticeably older here than in her previous two outings , a miracle on 34th street and matilda , still retains her feckless charm and unforced acting style . the worst thing about the movie is martin short . under ideal circumstances , short can be grating , but here , attempting to mimic jim carrey , he's occasionally unbearable . the scenes where he's not around tend to be a simple wish's most entertaining . the plot flows along the lines of a modern-day , fractured fable . at least a simple wish never takes itself seriously . it knows that it's a silly film , and everyone plays along , keeping the tone somewhere between relaxed and campy . kathleen turner and amanda plummer have fun chewing on the scenery , although their antics are mercifully restrained compared to short's . francis capra manages to be a little less obnoxious here than he was in kazaam , and robert pastorelli ( michael ) brings an appealing mixture of dignity and likeability to his role . there are times when the film's self-deprecating humor is amusing . the script refers to and/or pokes fun at such targets as bedtime stories , broadway musicals in general and andrew lloyd webber in particular , shakespeare , the wizard of oz , and , incredibly , citizen kane ( watch the snow globe ) . it would all be a lot more enjoyable if martin short didn't keep interrupting . it's easy to tell that a simple wish doesn't have the limitless budget of universal's other recent summer release , the lost world . spielberg's summer blockbuster was defined by state-of-the-art special effects . a simple wish is hampered by some rather cheap-looking visuals . the film's attempts at magic are awkward to watch . for example , there's a group of digitally-designed frogs that allow the viewer to appreciate just how impressive the budweiser tv commercial creations are . i assume the target group for a simple wish is basically the same one as for last year's matilda . a number of similar elements are in place : a plucky heroine played by mara wilson , magic , echoes of dickens , a cartoon-like villain , and a happy ending . of course , since a simple wish isn't as skillfully constructed and is saddled with martin short , the best advice i can offer is to rent matilda now and wait for a simple wish to hit video shelves in the near future . it won't take too long -- this film doesn't have the strength or stamina to stand up against the other mid-july competition . 
he's downright filthy . played wonderfully against type by denzel washington , alonzo is the role that could win washington ( the hurricane and malcolm x ) his long deserved best actor oscar to go along with his supporting actor oscar for glory . you may find yourself feeling almost uneasy given how much you enjoy watching his character . you want to loathe him , and you do , but washington gives alonzo a disturbingly appealing side . this strongly violent film never pulls its punches . hoyt enters the day nervous that he won't be found worthy of being a narc and ends it nervous that he won't see the sunrise . in between is one terrific motion picture , albeit a depressingly engrossing one . hoyt doesn't know quite what to make of alonzo and constantly seems confused as to what is happening . alonzo makes it almost plausible that smoking dope is important training . " are you a wolf or a sheep . " but alonzo isn't just any wolf . it's all very disorienting . interlaced with these close-ups are slow-motion shots that give the audience a constant feeling of dread . although the conclusion is satisfying , it's too over the top and too long . if the last act were up to the quality of the rest of the movie , we might legitimately hear this film being talked about in the same breath as l . a . confidential and hear oscar buzz for it . instead , expect to see just washington's name in the oscar lineup . it is rated r for " brutal violence , pervasive language , drug content and brief nudity " and would be acceptable for older teenagers . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
david lynch's mulholland drive is a cross between a slow-motion episode of " the x files " and a super long version of " twin peaks . " a baffling but always intriguing failure , the movie gets more confusing , not less , as the story unfolds . lynch won the director's prize at this year's cannes film festival for the film . it would have been more appropriate if he had a gotten a dual award -- a first for directing and a booby prize for writing . lynch can make the simple act of walking down a small staircase ominous , but his script is full of bewildering and unrealistic characters for whom we care nothing . something bad is happening . " yours will probably be an equally simplistic , " huh ? " you'll be thinking that a lot during this movie , which needs a pictorial scorecard to keep track of all of the quirky characters who make brief appearances . almost every scene is full of foreboding , although the source of the danger is never quite clear . frequently lynch appears to have his camera dolly floating on a gently undulating sea in order to enhance the audience's queasiness . " i'm going to trust you to sort this thing out , " coco ( ann miller ) tells betty at one point . mulholland drive runs way too long at 2 : 26 . it is rated r for " violence , language and some strong sexuality " and would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
two if by sea is a putative comedy reminsent of the smokey and the bandit series . it was released without previews to most critics which is usually a sign that the studio thinks their movie is in trouble . other than being poorly written ( by first time writer denis leary ) , sloppily directed ( bill bennett ) , and overacted by every member of the cast , it does have a few redeming features like picturesque views of nova scotia . when the script is not getting on your nerves and the slured , mumbled bostonian accent so thick that you need subtitles is not driving you crazy , you at least get to relive slapstick comedy scenes from other bad movies . just to make sure you know they are trying to mimic other movies , one character says to other " who do you think you are , burt reynolds ? " in one of many derivative scenes , she throws their map out the window . i found this slapstick attempt at humor to be a total failure since the acting was so overboard . two minutes into the movie and the movie is such a stinker that it begins to reek . within fifteen minutes , i was ready to leave . my wife wanted to stay to see if it picked up ; it didn't . i confess that i actually saw all of this piece of drivel . okay , so i did go to the lobby once for five minutes to escape . the movie does have a plot . frank steals a painting which turns out to be more valuable than expected . if you care , you can guess everything that will happen after this . it takes many people to craft a movie this bad , but prime credit has to go to denis leary ( from the ref ) who not only gave a pathic acting performance but came up with a script full of inanities . his script has frank o'brien saying , " people like us are born in little houses and die in little houses , and we've got to find happiness somewhere in between . " inserted into the middle of a bad comedy , this line is totally out of place and does not work at all and even if it did , leary is incapable of delivering it in a believable fashion . there is not a character in the show that is realistic and certainly none you care about . in theory there are two romances in two if by sea . in reality there is no chemistry between anyone . bullock , whom i loved in speed and liked in the net , is given poor direction and manages to be incomprehensible and uninteresting . kotto seems to be suffering from gas in most of the movie . he just stands around and frowns in most scenes while saying little . the worst performance of the lot is robson's . whenever beano and his band of incompitent small time crooks get on the screen , you want to shut your eyes . i am amazed to report that some people in my audience actually laughed at some of this stuff . it is incorrectly rated r . there is no nudity , sex , or violence . the language is mildly bad in a few scenes . i would have rated it pg-13 and with the deletion of a couple of words , it could have been pg . on the other hand , i strongly recommend that you and your kids stay as far away from this movie as possible . i do give it one half of a star , but only because it did not quite crack the threshold of pain , i reserve for zero star movies . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
only a year later , smith made a studio-financed follow-up called mallrats , a film so widely reviled that smith publicly apologized for it , announcing " i don't know what i was thinking . " though he sometimes explores his themes with more earnestness than clarity , smith gives chasing amy both a wicked sense of humor and a genuine sensitivity about the complications of sexual politics . for the first half-hour of chasing amy , kevin smith concentrates on churning out the laughs with his often-crude , usually pop-culture-heavy dialogue . he shows an admirable willingness to take on potentially thorny topics like gay stereotypes -- there's a great sequence involving a gay black comic book writer ( dwight ewell ) who is forced to keep up a public image as a militant afro-centrist -- and a conversation about archie and jughead as gay lovers works despite its forced tarantino-as-a-slacker quality . smith even pulls off a riff on jaws in which banky and alyssa compare wounds from oral sex horror stories like an emotionally immature richard dreyfuss and a lesbian robert shaw ( though the flashback literalization of those stories is ill-advised ) . while the jokes are rarely profound , they are usually effective and delivered with zing by the actors . it doesn't help that two of the longer speeches are delivered by joey lauren adams , a talented actress but one whose jennifer tilly voice becomes grating when emotional scenes force her to wail for several minutes at a time . smith clearly wants to stretch himself beyond satiric comedy , but he never quite finds a pace which gives the more serious moments in chasing amy a spark to match their sincerity . it's a shame smith's romantic observations never quite click as drama , because his ideas are far more intriguing than most of what is served up in contemporary romantic comedies . there is an impressive lack of judgmental posturing in the way smith develops his characters , and he shows keen insight into how different people respond to societal norms about sexual behavior . it's simply clear that smith is still a guy who writes like people sitting around talking , and that style works much better with comedy than with drama . when it is at its funniest , chasing amy reminds you why everyone was so high on kevin smith in the wake of clerks . and even when it falters as a drama , it proves that smith isn't content with making clerks over and over . or , perhaps more important , that he won't make mallrats over and over . 
angela pope's hollow reed is one of the most striking , forceful films to emerge onto the american art house scene so far this year , but , like many powerful motion pictures , it can be extremely difficult to watch . and , while the beatings aren't as graphic or brutal as those in another recent domestic violence motion picture , once were warriors , they're all the more wrenching because , in this case , the victim is a ten year old boy . yet , if hollow reed's sole subject matter had been child abuse , it wouldn't have been as provocative or challenging . equality is a word that everyone loves to speak , but , in today's world , there are times when it remains a distant fantasy . part of the reason that hollow reed is so punishing is that it's told from a child's point-of-view . relating the story from oliver's perspective allows us to better understand the fear , confusion , and self-blame that the child experiences . physical damage isn't the only byproduct of abuse ; it has deep-reaching psychological ramifications as well , the effects of which can be far more lasting . oliver's reasons for not telling are complex , and hollow reed makes his silence on the subject seem completely rational under the circumstances . understandably , he doesn't like frank , but , while the movie casts him in the role of the villain , it manages to humanize him to a degree , offering a motivation for his actions . his impotence ratchets up the level of tension that pope works so hard to create . hollow reed isn't meant to be a thriller , but the tone is darker and more ominous than is typical for a drama . the key to donovan's performance is that it starts out low-key . however , all of the adults , including richardson , donovan , and the fine supporting cast , are outacted by young sam bould , who captures the essence of oliver without a hint of the confusion and awkwardness that sometimes marks child performances . bould has many memorable moments -- hiding under a work bench so that frank won't find him , preparing to defend himself with a chisel , and bravely enduring the punishment that frank dishes out . in life , there are no easy answers , and hollow reed is nothing if not an accurate mirror of reality . this is not the sort of motion picture that's likely to find favor with the " feel good " crowd , but , if you aren't afraid of a movie that is capable of challenging convictions and wrenching emotions , hollow reed makes for an unforgettable two hours . 
nothing like low expectations to enhance your movie-going pleasure . invited to a special theatrical screening of bharat nalluri's the crow : salvation , recently released on tape and dvd , i wasn't particularly looking forward to it . although i wouldn't quite go so far as to recommend it , the movie does have a terrific look and some intriguing , albeit overly dramatic , acting . the script is so over the top that it would probably work better for an animated movie than a live-action production . think of the film as a cross between dark city and a charles bronson revenge thriller . shot impressively by carolyn chen , the movie has a striking look of dark blues shrouded in fog . the red of the ever-present blood serves as the main contrast to the film's bluish tint . if you rent the movie and you find the story a bit too ludicrous , you can always enjoy the visuals . it is rated r for pervasive strong violence and for sexual content and language . it would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
a good old-fashioned mystery yarn , from john dickson carr , but this time instead of the lady vanishes , it is the husband who does . oddly enough , the one person who clearly saw her , the stewardess , denies seeing her . the story itself , if examined closely had many improbabilities , but the strength of the film is in the tension it creates within crain and how she handles it . she had a blind trust in him and it is hard for me to imagine another person in her situation acting as naively as she does . but even if i didn't find the plot to be always plausible , the relationship that developed between her and rennie was credible . this b&w melodrama was always suspenseful : there was the constant heavy fog that made things mysterious . crain seemed so helplessly alone , highlighted by showing her sitting by herself at the dining table and feeling that she is losing her mind , that set the mood for the entire film and her vulnarability is what the viewer identifies with . this excellently paced b-film , is tersely directed and superbly acted . the film seemed to be thrust forward by the credibility of the characters playing parts that were incredible .

screenplay : david lynch and barry gifford . director : david lynch . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , violence , profanity ) running time : 134 minutes . please don't bother asking me what lost highway is " about , " because i have only the vaguest idea . i'm also not particularly bothered by that fact , any more than i am bothered by not knowing what a bosch painting or a given chapter in " ulysses " is " about . " a linear narrative is not a pre-requisite for the evocation of an emotional response , and david lynch is one of the few artists who has tried to push the limits of cinema as a medium of sound , images and possibilities . lost highway is lynch at his best and his worst , as unnerving as it is excessive . any attempt to describe the plot of lost highway is ultimately an exercise in futility , but essentially it involves two uniquely connected story-lines . there is little doubt in my mind that , when he is working at the top of his form , david lynch can turn our darkest unspoken fears into brilliant cinema like no other living director . there are nightmare visions in lynch projects which can leave you shaking for days , and there are moments during the first hour of lost highway which build and release tension with an almost unbearable skill . long stretches of silence are punctuated by sudden bursts of sound ; characters drift into darkness in shots that linger long enough to make you start peeking through your fingers . with its eerie production design and slowly mounting paranoia , lost highway begins to cast a spell which will have viewers anxious but intrigued . too bad it takes such a short time to lose those viewers entirely . the fred-to-pete transformation is not a fatal error in and of itself , though audiences used to conventional narratives may be baffled by it . the real villain in the collapse of lost highway is lynch's inability to ground the film so that its world makes internal sense . eraserhead's landscape was unquestionably surreal ; blue velvet , as unsettling as it was , always focused on the horrors of the real world . the mistake in lost highway isn't the outrageous character shift , but the way the other characters in the film respond to that event as a problem to be solved . if lost highway is about psychosis made flesh , about psychological duality becoming physical duality , it falls short of pulling you into that world because it has given you the impression that there is an " answer . " and while you're busy giving yourself a headache trying to solve that mystery , you aren't getting caught up in the atmosphere of the mystery itself . lost highway contains too many individual moments of vintage lynch to be considered a failure . the grimly comic violence , the degraded sexuality and the languid exchanges of dialogue are all familiar , and seem more like self-plagiarism than a characteristic style . lynch often seems more interested in re-creating than creating , in taking the perfect 10's of his career and cranking them up to 11 . for its first hour , lost highway is brilliant , and there are flashes of that brilliance for another 75 minutes , but they don't hold together because there isn't a consistent tone or structure to sustain them . in a film where everything seems to be in two places at once , it is fitting that lost highway doesn't stay in any one place long enough . 
trials and questions of guilt and innocence are nothing new , but guilty as sin has a few twists that give this film a different slant than many other courtroom thriller/dramas . limited though it is , the strength of this picture lies not in a tense verbal jousting match between prosecuting and defense attorneys , because there isn't one , nor is it to be found in the " did he do it/didn't he " theme , since the truth is revealed relatively early . much of the story , while admittedly overplotted , is cleverly-conceived and fun to watch . that's what makes the ending such a colossal disappointment . often , the final act of a film has little impact on the overall quality of the product . there are a number of good films that have weak conclusions , and a few horrible movies that surprise with unexpectedly-solid wrap-ups . guilty as sin , however , is an example of how an ending can ruin the entire picture . without revealing anything plot-wise , let me simply state the final moments lead to an inept and feeble letdown . it's almost as if someone different was brought in to do the writing . what's worse is that it's easy to construct scenarios that would have made a fitting conclusion to an otherwise-intriguing and entertaining film . while the end of guilty as sin is by far the film's most grievous fault , it is by no means the only sour point . some of the dialogue could have used a re-write or two . there are a number of lines that are unintentionally funny , and this is a bad sign for a movie trying to develop tension . fortunately , he doesn't have a large role . there are scenes when she does an excellent job , but an equal number when she is amateurish , stilted , or unconvincing . strong emotion appears to be something that she has difficulty portraying effectively . he plays the role to the hilt , pulling out all the stops and more than occasionally overacting . what he does is perfect for the movie , and immensely fun to watch ( it also helps to erase the memory of an execrable performance in born yesterday ) . there aren't many movies when i find myself sympathizing with the villain , but this is among the exceptions , johnson's acting putting me solidly in greenhill's corner . oddly enough , another recent example of this occurred when i rooted for demornay's paige in the hand that rocks the cradle . comparisons can be made to jagged edge , but most of the similarities are superficial . aside from edge being a better-crafted piece of entertainment , there's a lot to differentiate the two . guilty as sin will not win any awards for realism , but as escapism it's fine--until the ending , that is . it's disappointing and amazing how a few ill-conceived pages of script can shatter what might otherwise have been a shallow-but-enjoyable thriller . what a waste . 
screenplay : mark verheiden . director : peter hyams . a muscular action hero with a thick accent stars in a science fiction film about traveling into the past to change the future . no , i'm not talking about the terminator , although i suspect the similarity is more than coincidental . jean-claude van damme has labored through several virtually indistinguishable testosterone fests without discovering his breakout hit , so timecop must have seemed like the perfect opportunity . and it will probably do what it was intended to do , expanding van damme's audience the way the terminator expanded arnold schwarzenegger's . it's an energetic film that doesn't skimp on the action , but it suffers from an over-convoluted storyline that pushes the logic meter * way * into the red zone . however , those are not the issues which hamper timecop most . there is more fundamental foolishness , like what exactly the t . e . c . either there has been an inordinate number of rogue timecops , or there was a spectacular level of stupidity involved in not destroying the other machine . one also wonders why assassins from the future can't be slightly less obtrusive than extras from the road warrior . while reuben is good working with sketchy material , the character appears too late and disappears too soon to leave any kind of impact on the story . everything about the fielding character feels contrived , sloppy and , worst of all , completely unnecessary . director peter hyams went a little nuts in the editing room , making some of van damme's fight scenes look like they were lit with a strobe , but they are mostly creative and well- choreographed ; only the final showdown drags on a bit . the special effects are sharp , and the computer-generated snap-back look to the characters' movements through time is inventive and well-handled . the production values are generally impressive , and action fans will not be too disappointed . the real pleasant surprise of timecop turns out to be the acting of jean-claude van damme . yes , that's right , i said acting . though still sometimes difficult to understand through his belgian accent , van damme is an appealing performer who looks comfortable on screen , something steven seagal has yet to accomplish . timecop isn't exactly a demanding film for an actor , but van damme shows that he can provide texture , something a bit more substantive than roundhouse kicks . he also gets to work off a suitably nasty villain in ron silver , who is perfectly cast , and has a nice chemistry with the too-little-seen mia sara . it's too bad timecop often feels bloated and preposterous , because there's a bit of heart lurking beneath the hardware . it's just a bit too uneven to take advantage of its strengths . 
danish director lars von trier's highly acclaimed film breaking the waves explored its protagonist's conflict between her love and her god . norwegian director berit nesheim's the other side of sunday covers similar ground , but rather than a newlywed , its heroine is a young teenage girl facing the horrors of puberty . breaking the waves is close to the top of just about every critic's best of the year list for 1996 , and , although trier's picture is the better of the two films , i was similarly moved by both . american movies are obsessed with violent subject matter , and yet , luckily , violence rarely affects most of us personally . given all the life threatening situations movie characters encounter , you would expect to see them resort to prayer fairly often , but you do not . this film ignores violence and focuses its attention on faith and love . like the rebellious heroine in welcome to the dollhouse , maria is a young teen . if she had a single wish , it would probably be bigger breasts . arne borsheim's handsome cinematography is quietly in evidence , especially in the outdoor scenes . the music by bent aaserud and geir bohren for this gentle film is suitably lovely and moving , and many of the pieces have religious overtones . maria even gets into theological arguments with her father on jesus's need to go to the bathroom -- just like everyone else . let us pray and laugh . " much of the film deals with maria's exploration of her budding sexuality . this is a rich film and has all of the truth of life . it is so easy to empathize with maria's frustrations and temptations . this deeply wounds her self-esteem . " i believe in god , " she almost weeps . " i really do . but i want to be pretty too . " a powerful film with simple , heartfelt performances by all . the script by lasse glomm , berit nesheim , and reidun nortvedt is full of lines that are naturally provocative and yet ring totally true . a gem that , sadly , few will probably ever discover . i saw it at the press screening for san jose's cinequest film festival . i hope an american distributor picks it up . it deserves the wider audience than it will ever get . this sort of cinema does not . it is in norwegian with easy to follow english subtitles . it is not rated , but would get an r . there are nudity , sexual situations , and a few profanities . the film would be fine for teenagers . i recommend this picture to you highly and give it * * * . i came close to rating it higher . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 16 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
kopple had a real challenge in constructing an interesting film since woody turns out to be as dull as his movies are exciting . it reminded me of a two-person junior high school skit i was in , in which i was supposed to be playing " a member of the elite society , " whatever that meant . the most striking conclusion from viewing the movie is how incredibly unhappy woody is even with millions of fans and dollars . even when playing the new orleans style jazz that he reportedly loves , he looks miserable . grimacing with his eyes closed , he produces music that can be described as , well , pleasant , but he makes it look less like a labor of love than something to be endured . woody , although he clearly mugs for the camera at times , seems fairly natural . one even has its own large , indoor swimming pool with elaborate tiled mosaic floors that looks like it was last seen in an episode of " i , claudius . " with enormous doses of woody's music , the film spends little time analyzing what attracts woody to it . " there's nothing there between you and the pure feeling of playing , " woody says , giving us some hint of his motivation . " there's no cerebral part to it . " in one of the film's little insights , woody talks about why europeans like his movies better than americans . europeans even love his films , such as interiors , that bombed in the us . " the europeans like pictures that drone on , and i'm good at making pictures that drone on , " he explains . what may surprise woody's fans is that he is rarely funny in person and sometimes surprisingly inarticulate . ( " i'm appropriately animate for a human being in the context in which i exist , " is his retort to soon-yi's criticism of his lack of gestures on stage . ) actually , the film serves as proof that he doesn't enjoy anything . " you are so happy to be so intelligent , " one party guest , whose native tongue isn't english , tells woody . it is rated pg for a single use of the f-word and would be fine for kids around twelve and up . 
soon a swirl of unanswered questions arise that make it clear that someone may be abusing oliver , but if so , who ? hollow reed is a great film of intense power and ensemble acting that tells the story of these two families . films like this defy characterization . the exquisite script by neville bolt and paula milne is a thriller and a mystery , an examination of child abuse , a discussion of what constitutes a family , an exploration of trust and love , and most of all , a character study . ( every time i try to tell my friends what sling blade is about , i can see from the looks on their faces that they will never go see it . so i fear it may be with hollow reed . the more you know about the superficial aspects of the plot , the less likely you are to want to see it , and yet this compelling film has the power of secrets and lies and deserves a wide audience . ) in a cast of wonderful actors , martin donovan , playing the father martyn , stands out for his incredible and yet understated performance . new film actor sam bould gives a touching performance as the small boy , ollie , at the heart of the controversy . but you must know , what is he covering up and why ? in excellent minor roles , david calder , from the bramwell tv series on masterpiece theater , plays martyn's sincere , but not very reassuring lawyer . even better is edward hardwicke as the judge who looks as though he may require the wisdom of solomon to sort the case out . the script takes care to build a detailed story , not the outline with which most plots content themselves . although the mystery is fairly transparent , director angela pope nevertheless manages to keep the tension high . in the best of thrillers , of which this is one , the eerie calmness of most of the scenes creates more foreboding than cataclysmic events ever could . there is a composed , redemption scene that will have you wanting to scream , " no ! " and when hannah says , " it'll never happen again , " about the abuse , your stomach will likely go into knots . i am not going to give anything away . if you've seen the trailers or read any of the other reviews , you already know more than the little i've told you . i want you to see the film fresh so its power can overwhelm you as it did me . although never manipulative , the intelligent script and moving acting may reduce you to tears even though almost all of the abuse happens off screen . i saw it at a press-only screening with only a half dozen critics present , but i could hear frequent weeping around me . rarely does this happen at such an event . the ending of the movie is strikingly photographed by remi adefarasin and directed with precision and power by angela pope . although the brief epilog afterwards is satisfying , since it allows you to know how the players put their lives back together , it detracts slightly from the film's intensity . then again , perhaps most viewers need that catharsis to make their emotional system whole again after such an experience . it is not rated but would be an r for mature themes , language , sex , and nudity . this is not an nc-17 film , and the abuse is of a physical and not a sexual nature . the film would be fine for mature teenagers . i recommend the picture strongly and give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
starring : susan sarandon , brad renfro , tommy lee jones , mary-louise parker , anthony lapaglia , j . t . walsh , anthony edwards , ossie davis director : joel schumacher producers : arnon milchan and steven reuther screenplay : akiva goldsman and robert getchell based on the novel by john grisham cinematography : tony pierce-roberts music : howard shore released by warner brothers this time around , i thought i'd do things a little differently . for both the firm and the pelican brief , i made my way through the written version before approaching the cinematic one . neither book dazzled me , and the impressions given by the movies were less memorable . so , for the client , i decided to eschew grisham's novel altogether and see if , divorced from its source material , joel schumacher's film could provide a couple hours of light entertainment . it's not difficult to understand why the firm , the pelican brief , and the client have all been bestsellers . they're tightly-written , don't require a lot of concentration , have very simple storylines , and can be read in a sitting or two . in essence , they're what someone i know calls " good trash . " unfortunately , his writing makes for a perfect hollywood screenplay--lots of action and not much originality . the client's greatest disadvantage is its flat plot , which includes few ( if any ) surprises and revolves on a premise that we've seen before--in the firm and the pelican brief , among others . the client's premise is tenuous in its believability . why ? i guess we're supposed to believe that the kid is scared and confused , but he does enough clear-headed things to limit the plausibility of this explanation . despite plot holes and contrivances , the client is a well-made motion picture . everything about it ( except the screenplay ) is top-notch . the cast is impeccable . newcomer brad renfro portrays mark with a palpable mix of anger and fear . susan sarandon gives her usual solid performance , and tommy lee jones oozes equal parts charisma and false charm . mary-louise parker , one of the better representatives of today's crop of twentysomething actors , is underused as mark's mother dianne , but she makes the most of every scene she's in . schumacher has succeeded where two other accomplished directors ( sydney pollack , who did the firm , and alan pakula , of the pelican brief ) have failed : bringing a grisham novel to the screen in a manner that's more entertaining than trying . this isn't a masterpiece of suspense , but it has its moments and is capable of providing some light summer entertainment . i think from now on , i'll skip reading grisham's books and wait for the movies . if nothing else , it will save me some time . 
a poorly crafted revenge action film , that seems to be satisfied with itself for being so muddled and image conscious . gonin is a slickly done visual treat in bizarre behavior and violence , with homoerotic overtones . this is a nonstop action flick styled after those recent hong kong action films of john woo , ringo lam , and tsui hark . since i'm not a fan of the originators of this genre , i'm especially not partial to their imitators . " gonin , " which means 'the five , ' is devoid of character development and a coherent story , or anything but mindless blood-and-gore and an outpouring of jump-cuts and fast editing . but even with all those filmmaking tricks of the trade , the action scenes seem like they're in slo-mo when compared to the hong kong ones . the hitmen quickly locate all of them since the gang fails to cover-up their identities properly , and the film becomes a vehicle for showy performances . the only memories from this film are of the gruesome kind , as killing is the thing here and director ishii--who used to illustrate manga--hyperrealistic , action-packed japanese comics--goes all the way with this theme by making it into a cartoonlike story . there's definetly an audience for this type of cultish film , except don't count me as one of those happy viewers . i prefer my violent flicks to make a little more sense and have at least some character development . tarantino's reservoir dogs looks like a shakespearian classic compared to this b-film , one that hopes to get by with its all-star cast and the menacing performance by the indomitable takeshi " beat " kitano . 
beautiful isn't . a lifeless , mean-spirited film , it arrives doa at your local theater today . advertised as a comedy , the picture , thanks to sally's field's inept direction and jon bernstein's dull script , is , instead , a depressing drama . with beauty pageants as its subject , beautiful should have been an easy success . is there anything easier to satirize than beauty pageants ? last year's marvelously funny drop dead gorgeous showed what is possible . even if beautiful can't rise to that level , does it have to be so painful to watch ? every performance is gratingly awful , and all the roles are badly miscast . attractive minnie driver , as mona hibbard , the story's protagonist , doesn't have the body for a beauty pageant winner . she's a terrific actress , but even she can't pull this one off , especially given how badly and unsympathetically her part is written . to give you an idea of just how ugly beautiful can be , one of the key subplots concerns mona's disowning her own daughter , vanessa . it seems that you can't be miss american miss if you have children . incidents in beautiful will more likely have you going " yuck " than laughing . at least it works so that we don't witness child abuse . since the teenaged mona isn't even finishing in " the top 20 " of contests that don't seem to have more than a dozen entrants , she hires a beauty consultant . any movie willing to have kathleen turner in it is bound to be a stinker . yes , she was once a good actress . beautiful should have been released as a tv movie . if so , it would have been a decidedly below average tv movie . actually , were it not for sally field and minnie driver being associated with the production , it would never have been released in any venue . it is rated pg-13 for language and thematic elements . although it would be acceptable for kids 11 and up , i would not recommend this to anyone of any age . 
there is no dialogue or narrator in the first version i saw , but in the later version ed mcmahon does the narration . these are some very weird freudian dream sequences . but the narrator poses the question , is it a dream of madness on a dark night -- or was it real ? this is a bizarre film , a precursor to welles' " touch of evil " and polansky's " repulsion . " if not made to be understandable , it is at least a very demanding depiction of someone demonically possessed by guilt . 
a masterfully done noir piece . it is the kind of work that pre-dated the great jean-pierre melville's classic bob the gambler . characteristics have now become part of gangster film lore : that is , whenever gangsters are pictured in a romantic and old-fashioned manner . what distinguishes this film over most other noir films , is the grace it has and its ability to take its time and do a real character study of what max is like . and the director was just as interested in doing those scenes , as he was in filming the action ones . a great b/w film in every way possible . it has a hypnotic rhythm about it that takes you right into the gangster atmosphere it presents on screen ; there is not one wasted shot . 
here , the director , himself a rom member , is in love with the gypsies -- their foibles and all -- and plays a joke with their worldwide pejorative image by reversing the things usually said about gypsies , and having the gypsies say them about the foreigners . the film has caught the gypsy mood and their persona : the gypsies here have gold teeth , the women bathe together in the nude and talk about the men in a frank sexual manner , the men drink a lot , play music with deep feelings , curse on a regular basis , and are quick to smile and see the humor in almost everything they do . may i rot ! " they shout in excitement , " there's a great big gadjo sleeping at our place ! " " gadjo dilo , " in the gypsies' romany language , means " crazy stranger , " which becomes a reference to the french youth and the film's title . for the director , the question becomes , how is it , whenever events turn bad , the gypsy community is almost always made the scapegoat . gatlif succeeded in setting an evocative gypsy mood , touching on their charms , highlighting their moving music , demonstrating the sheer joy in their wedding ceremonies , and leaving a good taste in one's mouth about the gypsy spirit to survive . though the film doesn't tell a great story but a conventional one , even with all the exotic atmosphere the film exudes in , but it still holds one's interest throughout , as the moods change and gypsy life takes a more dramatic turn . 
screenplay : barry schneider & richard hawley . director : yves simoneau . hey , mr . development executive , have i got a pitch for you . now here's the casting twist : jamie lee curtis , scream queen ingenue of late 70s/early 80s horror films as the * villain * . give it a french director and some moody photography to make it look more respectable , and voila ! you've got a bona fide hit on your hands , right ? well , probably not . mother's boys occupies that unfortunate middle ground between teen scarefest and pop phenom psychothriller , inevitably limiting its audience . it also swings wildly from the subtly creepy to the just-plain-dumb . robert will have none of it , but jude is more than determined--she's sociopathic . mother's boys is one of those movies where it's easy to spend a lot of time picking apart flaws in logic , if logic is something you expect from your thrillers . i suppose it would have been too stereotypical for callie to be * just * a teacher . then there are silly details like the band-aid which is supposed to cover the cut on jude's forehead , and " cliche alert " problems like the use of not one , not two , but * three * nightmare sequences . the script is sloppy in its attempt to explain jude's pathology , and the character development is virtually non-existent . yet for all that , mother's boys still almost won me over on style points alone . from the eye-catching opening credits to the climax , director yves simoneau gives the production a smoky , dreamlike atmosphere which maintains tension throughout . the story is thankfully short on gothic excess , and i was pleasantly surprised by the twist to jude's plan . jamie lee curtis is generally well- directed , veering into the overblown only rarely . finally , it leaves kes at a point of uncertainty , a rarity in films of any kind . while it may not have done much for my brain , mother's boys did get my skin crawling . what disappointed me about mother's boys was that i thought it made the wrong choices about jude . once the choice was made to go in the latter direction , mother's boys committed itself to being a thriller , and ultimately it's not that scary . how much more interesting it would have been to watch jude turn all three boys against callie , be more subtle in her seduction of robert , or make callie want to leave . 
simplicity , sincerity , and realism are the hallmarks of ken loach's raining stones . although possessing the grittiness and rare honesty of mr . loach's previous project , riff raff , this is not a re-telling of that story . anyone familiar with the director's work , however , will recognize the characteristic style . dark locales , underexposed interiors , and actors with accents so thick that some might find subtitles helpful--all these elements are synthesized to deliver an amazingly real portrait of life as a member of middleton's unemployed and underprivileged . there's no preaching in raining stones , and the narrative never condescends to the characters , no matter what their circumstances are . this movie presents life as it is--no regrets or complaints . without ever mentioning politics , mr . loach makes the most powerful and effective of political statements--one that relies on subtlety and the intelligence of the audience . the plot is entirely believable and never predictable , simply because it goes against the grain of what typically comes out of hollywood . jim allen's script mixes portions of unforced comedy and natural tension into a deceptively straightforward tale that would find few takers in the film making mainstream . the characters are realized by little-known actors who deserve greater recognition , at least based on the strengths of their performances here . raining stones is a mirror that reflects our times , with themes that are universal . you don't have to be a resident of middleton to understand what director ken loach is saying . that there is humor and warmth in the midst of such poverty speaks volumes for the indomitable spirit of humanity , not to mention the strength of this movie's ability to capture that . 
life in this remote country village , called varkut , is oppressive , with nothing to do but work hard and eat a lot and watch bland tv programs . there is a coldness and distance about her , that speaks ill of hungarian society and its lack of warmth . the fierce b/w camera work captures the look of devastation on his face . the oppression is so great , that it is not even overtly mentioned , it is just taken for granted . but it is not pity that she needs , nor is it love that she can find or thinks she needs . this first feature-length directorial effort of m ? sz ? ros is staggering emotionally . its heartfelt dramatics and sparse dialogue , help make it a film of great quality and integrity . there is no soft pedaling of reality to spare the orphan's feelings . 
director lawrence kasdan's latest movie is a romantic comedy called french kiss . all of his actors have unique and compelling personalities . this was one of his non-epic movies , but it certainly was populated with some fascinating and quirky characters . i want to confess up front that grand canyon was number one on my list in 1991 and big chill was in 1983 so i am huge fan of kasdan's body of work . the writing by adam brooks was quite funny . this piece of slapstick was pathetic and belonged , if anywhere , in another movie . i have no idea why the editor left it in . kasdan's directing was in the style of the big chill but with more comedy and less pretense about the need to deliver a message . granted , there was a message in the movie , but it was subtle and tertiary to the plot and the subplot . my respect for kasdan's craft continues . i frequently will think more of the writer or the director than the actors in a movie because writers and directors are the unsung heroes who are the determinates of whether a picture moves you or bores you . in french kiss , as good as the writing and the directing was , it was ultimately the incredible performance by kevin kline that made the movie . kline is a versatile actor who has made the screen come alive in many other films . my two recent favorite roles of his were in dave and in princess caraboo - both of which i recommend highly . there is no role of his , including his academy award winning role in a fish called wanda , that i liked better . this film has to be rated a must see for all of you kevin kline fans . i would go to see any film with meg ryan in it . she is cute , captivating , and intelligent yet always child-like and vulnerable . in french kiss , she is terrific and yet , her performance pales in comparison to kline's . this is his movie . in the year 1980 , timothy hutton was brilliant in ordinary people . it has been straight down hill for him ever since . he has been so bad in many recent films , e . g . , made in heaven , that they made my worst of the year list . he stays consistent and never bothers to act or show any emotion in french kiss . this is no easy feat since he is being actively pursued by someone as cute as ryan and as drop down dead gorgeous as anbeh . hutton manages to be oblivious to both . major control i suppose or ice water in his veins . the acting by the minor characters is good . reno plays the cop with a fresh approach . i especially liked the acting by anbeh , who takes a minor part with almost no lines , and manages to make the just stand there and look beautiful role interesting . i wish i knew the names of the costume designers and the makeup artists since i think they deserve special mention . the costumes , especially the evolution of the costumes and the makeup for the two women leads was a key to the success of the film . you can see it in the clothes , the make up , and in juliet's later , stark hairdos . the cinematography was striking without ever being traveloguesque . if you notice the fade to black of the most of the scenes , it fades fast at first but then lingers until only a dark shadow against a black background remains reminiscent of a memory locked into our subconsciousness . as someone who grew up in the 50s and 60s , i liked the double meaning of the title . when i was a young boy , a french kiss was a proscribed activity that you giggled about in the schoolyard and yet anxiously and fervently awaited your first chance at it . french kiss runs just right at 1 : 50 . it is rated pg-13 for some bad language , subdued sex , references to drugs , massive smoking by luc , and adult themes . this was crazy for it surely bored them all . for the adult humor and romance , i would say kids older than 9 or 10 would like it . i recommend it to you and award it * * * . for comparison purposes , i should say that i prefer the other current romantic comedy , while you were sleeping , over this one , although they were close enough that i rated them the same . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : may 5 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
a fine example of a 1940s type of film noir , as adapted from a cornell woolrich novel . the acting was commendable and the development of the dark noir world was very well established ; but , the case itself seemed hardly believable-- the dialogue was atrocious , and the crazed , genius killer looking down at his hands and getting dizzy spells was more ridiculous than a truthful presentation . the film had too many defects that just couldn't be overlooked , yet overall it had a mesmerizing effect--largely due to the imaginative direction robert siodmak gave it . 
" the way i see it , you have people who own lawns and people who mow them , " trent says , explaining his role at the bottom of the social hierarchy . full of self-deprecating humor , trent faces his reduced opportunities in life with spunk but not much hope . as the quirky film starts , it looks like another plastic parody , but director john duigan has something else entirely in mind . the imaginative director of sirens stages scenes in ways shocking , surprising , and generally quite satisfying . with rampant sexuality , violent undertones , and fascinating characters , the film has something for everyone . the central character in this modern fable is a precocious , 10-year-old girl , devon stockard , played with wonderful complexity by newcomer mischa barton . she delivers a riveting performance that constantly surprises . with her wide-eyes and broad smile , she is devilishly delightful and ever inquisitive . although devon seems as though she might turn into a lolita , she never does . devon's wildness comes out in other vivid ways . kathleen quinlan , whose specialty is loyal , suffering housewives , plays an erotically charged one this time . the director's talents are best seen in those scenes in which he transforms weed pulling and salad preparation into incredibly erotic undertakings . lawn dogs , like sirens , basically defies description . suffice it to say that it has just about everything in it , including a director who knows precisely how to combine the ingredients in amazing and compelling ways . the performance by young mischa barton alone is worth the price of admission . it is not rated but would be an r for nudity , sexual situations and violence and would be fine for older teenagers . 
all the characters are present . perhaps the best bit of casting is the choice of walter matthau as mr . wilson , the grumpy neighbor who becomes the frequent target of dennis' pranks . sam's inclusion is perhaps the movie's biggest mistake since it takes the focus away from the more interesting dennis/mr . at least in the two home alone movies , the victims were bad guys . here , while mr . wilson isn't the most affable of neighbors , he certainly isn't a villain , and is undeserving of the cruel treatment dished out to him . recycling old formulas is , in fact , the big problem . even setting aside the reuse of home alone material , there's nothing original in this film . countless pictures have explored this theme , including the recent offerings cop and an half and life with mikey . dennis the menace has nothing to offer that those two didn't , and that immediately puts it in pretty poor company . in general , i didn't find dennis the menace particularly funny , although the kids in the audience enjoyed it . there's nothing repugnant about the film . like home alone , it's a live-action cartoon . there are a few worthwhile moments , the best of which may be the one that goes on side-by- side with the closing credits . almost all the scenes featuring dennis and mr . wilson are entertaining ( although the occasional attempts at pathos are out of place ) . unfortunately , these are too few . pleasantly surprising is the likability of mason gamble's dennis . gamble's cute performance becomes more endearing than obnoxious , combining the same mixture of innocence , enthusiasm , and vulnerability that made macaulay culkin a star . these two are so annoying that i was yearning for dennis to plunk them both with slingshot-launched marbles . some concern has been expressed about the image that christopher lloyd's character presents of a homeless person . i contend that rather than giving a negative impression of the homeless , with which he is never clearly associated , switchblade sam will instead reinforce a lesson that is taught to children every day : don't talk to strangers . i don't see sam doing any more to affect opinions on the homeless than brenda fricker's amiable bag lady did in home alone 2 . dennis the menace is basically an innocuous movie . i think most children will get a kick out of it , and those adults roped into seeing it won't find themselves yearning to escape through the nearest exit ( as is unfortunately the case with too many " family films " ) . on the other hand , i wonder if dennis is worth the money . it isn't that much better than a lot of the current fare on television , and won't lose a whole lot in the translation from big screen to video . basically , there's nothing remarkable about this movie that demands for it to be seen . if you're running low on films to take the family to , dennis the menace will do . otherwise , it might be prudent to spend the time ( and money ) on something of a little better quality . 
screenplay : thomas ropelewski . director : john schlesinger . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , brief nudity ) running time : 105 minutes . you can be sure that the next best thing will find plenty of viewers unsympathetic to its message in support of unconventional family structure -- the christian coalition , for example , or the utah state legislature . we may have come a long way , baby , in matters of social tolerance , but we haven't come _that_ far . still , you would expect the people involved in making the next best thing to have the passion to turn it into a compelling story . john schlesinger is one of the few openly gay directors making hollywood films . and madonna well , i saw truth or dare , so i get the impression she's fairly familiar with alternative lifestyles . what , then , is the excuse for the next best thing turning out so generally dreary and uninspired ? as with many films , so far so good in the general concept department . it's only in the execution that the next best thing becomes an ordeal to endure . the character of abbie is the heart of the disaster , and i'd be inclined to blame screenwriter thomas ropelewski ( more on his faults to come ) if not for the screen performance tragedy that is madonna . these days , it's impossible to notice anything but that deliberate , affected speech pattern of hers . abbie does some pretty unsympathetic things over the course of the film , so it's crucial that she be played with some energy and charm . it's a performance so leaden it drags every single thing about the next best thing down along with it . with such a horrendous casting mistake at the heart of the next best thing , sapping it of any possible resonance , it's easy to tune out and spend great heaping chunks of the film mulling over its other faults . like , did ropelewski think there was a rule that any film featuring a gay character must have an aids-related sub-plot , no matter how irrelevant to the rest of the story ( hint : it could have been more relevant had there been an attempt to connect the question of surviving partners' rights to gay parents' rights ) ? why did usually reliable cinematographer elliot davis light the whole film as though we were in a cave , except for the morticia adams memorial eye , nose & throat spotlight used on madonna ? and what was with schlesinger's frequent use of fish-eye point-of-view perspectives that merely served to make a serio-comic tale occasionally border on the grotesque ? it's obvious that the next best thing wants to make a statement about inequities in the adjudication of custody matters , and question what it is that makes a parent . the statement and question are both valid , but that's all there is to this clumsy concoction . rupert everett is solid both comedically and dramatically , providing virtually all of the film's worthwhile moments , but he's the only thing about the next best thing that doesn't inspire far more head shaking than righteous indignation . sure , everyone involved was probably telling a story about which they felt deeply , and their hearts were certainly in the right place . when you're making a film , however , heart just isn't always enough . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david schow and john shirley . i have seen a number of reviewers falling over themselves to praise the crow , and i'm not convinced that many of them haven't been unduly influenced by the film's morbid history . i , like many , hoped that the crow would serve as a fitting epitaph to a budding star , and show that he hadn't died simply to make another schlocky action-fantasy . but sadly , that's basically what the crow is--a paper thin story supporting a lot of rain and moody lighting . all right , let's dispense with the formalities right off the top : the crow * looks * great . but there is very little the crow does visually that blade runner or batman didn't already do , and for the most part do better . proyas wheels out cliches like the cityscape on fire opening shot , the close-up of the hero's face dripping with rain , and lightning revealing something previously hidden in shadow . while the art direction and cinematography are striking , there is nothing original enough to obscure the glaring weaknesses in the rest of the film . the trouble begins with the script by david schow and john shirley , but the fact is that there's no way of knowing what changes were made as a result of lee's death . perhaps the original script didn't begin with eric and shelly already dead , giving more poignance to the story and a chance to understand what eric has lost beyond the snippets shown in flashback . what is true of eric's characterization is true of the characterizations right down the line : they're either lazy , or they just don't make sense . michael wincott does fine work as the villain , but the attempt to explain his motivation is one of the lamest in recent memory . however , i'm willing to admit that there may be only two relevant questions for most potential viewers of the crow : 1 ) is it a good action film ? the answer to #1 is , better than most ; the crow is well paced , well choreographed and is at least somewhat creative . as for #2 , it's hard to say . unlike most action stars , lee at least had english as his native language , and given time he might have become a good actor . but in the crow , he wasn't yet . and i can't help but think that if he were alive today , most critics wouldn't have bee so forgiving . 
if it's december or january , it must be time for " triumph over illness/handicap " films . into this crowded field comes the theory of flight , a quirky comedy-drama of romantic friendship starring kenneth branagh as richard hawkins , an artist so flighty that he actually does try to take flight . . . right off the roof of a building . cue soaring music and inspirational message . well , not exactly . thus unfolds a singularly odd sort of film , at once a dark comedy , an unconventional love story and , yes , a triumph over illness/handicap film . the strange thing about the theory of flight is that it's not always clear whose triumph over a handicap will be the focus of the film . as the narrative progresses , it becomes ever more clear that richard is the real protagonist of the piece , the character who is supposed to learn and change through this experience . unfortunately , he's also the character who is least interesting , and makes the least sense . there's something emotionally amiss with this fellow , that's for certain ; exactly what that something is , not so much . kenneth branagh ( apparently still suffering side effects from channeling woody allen in celebrity ) is all neurotic discomfort and goofy twitches . the character's intense desire to follow through on the bank robbery falls somewhere between melodramatic affectation and sincere-though-misguided expression of resolve , when only one or the other would truly clarify things . jane is a superb piece of characterization , never merely the self-pitying , hard-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside person with a handicap that has become such a cinematic cliche . though it's a challenging bit of physical acting for bonham carter to wrap her mouth around jane's slurred speech and adopt the distinctive movements , her finest moment is a silent one -- a pleading glance at richard as her voice synthesizer plays her recorded request . it's the clash between our interest in those two characters which prevents the theory of flight from soaring to the highest possible level . while richard's awakening to his own self-indulgence may be the point , it's still tedious watching him indulge himself when watching jane is so much more interesting . perhaps the problem is that there is too much high-concept to this tale , too many silly little bits of business to distract from genuine interaction between the two principal characters . it's hard for a love story to be great when you want one of the lovers to end up happy , and the other just to end up an adult . you have to commend the theory of flight for taking a slightly different flight plan towards soaring inspiration . it just can't quite get there on only one good wing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
a ponderous melodrama that even becomes more awkward by the film's end . the doctor prescribes for her a powerful pain-killing pill that is fatal if more than one is taken within an hour . 
stuart bliss has noticed that the birds are flying in the wrong direction , which is just one of many signs he has been picking up lately . is this all a paranoid delusion , or is he onto something big ? stuart bliss , by first-time director neil grieve , is a black comedy with the emphasis on the darkness . although it has sporadic touches of humor to temper the descent into madness , the monotonic story written by the director and the movie's star , michael zelniker , takes a relentless approach . never sympathetic or complex , the story's protagonist , stuart bliss ( zelniker ) , is a played as a cipher . with the vacant stare of a zombie , stuart movies through the picture like an automaton . the story itself holds so much promise that audiences will likely stay with it even though its slow pacing takes what would have been a fascinating short film and transforms it into a full-length , but soporific , movie . the story opens well with some good , subtle humor . with actors playing multiple roles , the movie tries to confuse the audience in much the same way that stuart is befuddled . the problem is that after a while the audience simply doesn't care any more . why the director created a stick figure lead is the movie's real mystery . a little variety in the acting , some real emotion , and a few laughs would have helped enormously . it is not rated but might be pg-13 for adult themes and would be fine for any teenager . the movie is in the process of getting a distributor and thus does not yet have a release schedule . 
it's the nature of our society to put people on pedestals . some wear the title of " hero " like a mantle ; to others , it is an albatross . you need look no further than the o . j . simpson story to see this . so what defines greatness ? this question , in conjunction with the reality gap that so often exists between the media's portrayal of a public figure and their actual personality , lies at the core of cobb , a new film from writer/director ron shelton , the man who brought us the baseball comedy bull durham . it is not a biography , though it contains biographical ( or pseudo-biographical , depending on how much you want to believe ) information . he claimed to be misunderstood , but the sad truth is that he was understood too well . bubbled with violence " , cobb represented the kind of man who could be admired only from a distance--the farther the better . with a lead character as abrasive as they come , cobb is not always a pleasant movie . at times , it is downright uncomfortable . the film is perhaps too long ; much of the last half-hour feels excessive and redundant . nevertheless , given such a forceful anti-hero , the viewer's horrified fascination lasts all one-hundred twenty-eight minutes , even to the end of the credits when cobb declares , " baseball is 100% of my life . " jones' on-target portrayal of the dying athlete is mesmerizing . robert wuhl has considerably less screen presence , but this serves only to highlight jones . there is a share of male bonding here , but not enough to turn cobb into a cloying buddy picture . and , thankfully , the title character is never redeemed . given a less talented performer , cobb could have been an awkward , over-the-top melodrama . as it is , however , the movie works much as mrs . parker and the vicious circle does--as an unobstructed view of human degradation and the damage it wreaks . forrest gump might say that " greatness is as greatness does . " cobb goes to pains to dispel this simplistic view . image has little to do with reality . tremendous statistics do not make for a tremendous person . when our heroes turn out to be less like dale murphy and more like ty cobb , we feel betrayed and slighted . on those occasions , we have only ourselves to blame because in our society , it's the . 367 lifetime batting average that earns the reverence , regardless of how despicable the man holding the bat is . 
temptress moon ( feng yue ) is a cinematic tone poem from director kaige chen . chen , whose last work was the highly regarded farewell my concubine , contents himself this time with dazzling the audience with a film of stunning beauty . populated by characters who are little more than window dressing , the picture delights the senses , but rarely involves the viewers . the characters are mere portraits on chen's mantle with the viewers becoming voyeurs into the two dimensional world he creates . the obtuse script by kaige chen , kei shu , and anyi wang represents a challenge . like an opera , you need to read the plot outline ahead of time to keep the main characters straight , and even then , some of the minor ones will confuse you . after meticulously following the story , i realized in the end that it didn't matter . the movie's enjoyment comes from its visuals , so concentrating on the plot is a pointless diversion . nevertheless , i will describe some of story's highlights . the movie opens in china in 1911 . from its first scenes the movie overwhelms us with its nostalgic and romantic cinematography . the large and lush green leaves of the plants cut through the darkness as the boat plies its way forward . the pangs are cast as the timothy learys of that era . the story has gotten quite complicated by this point , but don't worry about it . just lean back and enjoy qiagui huang's handsome sets , listen to jiping zhao's longing music , admire william chang and chen changmin's gorgeous costumes and , most of all , soak in the radiance of christopher doyle's incredible cinematography . granted , the film does not have the beauty of shanghai triad , but it comes close . certainly , any film starring as lovely an actress as gong li ( to live and shanghai triad ) is worth seeing for that reason alone . the camera loves her , and , even if she demonstrates little of her considerable acting talent in temptress moon , she has a picture perfect smile . tone poems must be short to be effective . temptress moon wears out its welcome and goes on long past its natural ending point . when the inevitable tragic end occurred , i found myself unmoved and merely glad the movie was finally over . what had started out pleasantly enough had become repetitive and tiresome . temptress moon runs too long at 2 : 00 . the film is in chinese with english subtitles . it would be fine for older teenagers , but i would worry that younger ones would not be able to see through the pro-drug beliefs of the pang family . i enjoyed watching the movie's visuals , but not enough to be able to recommend the film . i give it * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
screenplay : terry gilliam & tony grisoni and tod davies & alex cox . director : terry gilliam . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , brief gore , drug use , adult themes ) running time : 115 minutes . terry gilliam's fear and loathing in las vegas is about as faithful an adaptation of hunter s . thompson's 1971 " gonzo journalism " classic as i can imagine . . . though that's not necessarily a good thing . the book has long been called " unfilmable , " which probably referred more to whether it _should_ be made than whether it _could_ be made . it's wild , perverse , incoherent , sometimes very funny , and too visually literal an adaptation of a book best left to a twisted imagination . in terms of tone , at least , it's a nearly flawless companion piece to thompson's book . they were essentially journalistic , clinical analyses where even the most unpleasant situations were softened with a dollop of deadpan , left-field humor . gilliam similarly finds the demented gag in every situation , including a hallucinogenic orgy of lounge lizards ( rendered as actual reptiles by makeup whiz rob bottin ) , while still acknowledging the squalor . with depp doing a hilariously spot-on performance of thompson-as-duke and del toro sporting plenty of extra flab as the unhinged dr . gonzo , fear and loathing in las vegas feels exactly like it should feel : a cockeyed white-water rafting tour down a polluted stream of consciousness . it's also true that an episodic film like fear and loathing is only as successful as its individual episodes . there are also several scenes which turn absolute fidelity to the source material into grinding sluggishness . a head-trip film like this one is better suited for 90 minutes of damn-the-torpedoes pacing than for this kind of reverence . gilliam also manages to extract thompson's one and only " message " regarding the drug culture of the 60s and early 70s . the film's temporal setting -- " this foul year of our lord nineteen hundred and seventy-one " -- is defined as a turning point in the use and perception of drugs , with the innocent notion of chemicals as reality-expanding tools giving way to chemicals as reality-numbing tools . even here gilliam's fidelity to the source undermines him , as images of vietnam and nixon point a too-obvious accusatory finger , with thompson's own unapologetic voice subverted by suggestions that he's just a victim of the times . the audience for a film as down and dirty as this one is limited anyway , but the now-anachronistic incorrectness man not even appeal to the like-minded . it's also consistently intriguing , if for no other reason than gilliam's willingness to go every ugly place thompson's book went . the only thing really wrong with gilliam's fear and loathing is that it's a movie , bringing into vivid color that which should only have lived on the page . gonzo film-making doesn't end up with quite the same rebellious spark . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala . producers : ismail merchant , david l . wolper . director : james ivory . mpaa rating : r ( brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . i'm not sure what it is that inspired the highly respected merchant ivory production team to turn from fiction to biography , but i wish they would drop it already . for years , director james ivory , producer ismail merchant and screenwriter ruth prawer jhabvala turned out exceptionally well-crafted adaptations of novels commonly held to be too difficult to film : a room with a view , howards end , the remains of the day . surviving picasso is not nearly as paralyzingly dull , but it demonstrates once again that real people seem to elude ivory and company . surviving picasso is a particularly frustrating piece of work because you can see what it is ivory was trying to do . mcelhone , a newcomer with piercing eyes , brings out the intelligence in francoise , but she becomes a distressingly passive character , even more so when she becomes a narrator for flashbacks . her unique personality has little chance to emerge , and even seems to be contradicted directly by a voice-over near the end in which francoise notes that picasso " made me strong . " picasso himself is similarly enigmatic , played by anthony hopkins as an egomanical bon vivant , turning his fame into a method for making people feel insignificant , and honored merely to be in his presence . ivory and jhabvala do a fine job of showing us the effect of picasso's behavior on those around him , but they are much less effective at showing us the man himself . we are never allowed inside the passionate artist ; hopkins is technically proficient , wandering accent notwithstanding , but his is a role which seems designed to be observed rather than understood . you can always count on a merchant ivory film to look splendid , and there is superb work once again from cinematographer tony pierce-roberts and production designer lucianna arrighi . it is a beautiful environment they have created for this story , but the characters in that environment are disappointing . there are several moments in surviving picasso which inspire a curiosity about this fascinating man , notably his rivalry with contemporary henri matisse ( joss ackland ) , but there is always the nagging sense , as there was in jefferson in paris , that ivory doesn't really have a point of view . his biographies are safe , almost documentary detailings of events in an individual's life which do not add up to a story . picasso and jefferson were both fascinating historical figures with private and public lives full of contradictions , and they should have made for great drama . ivory simply seems too respectful of his subjects , content to lay out events like they might appear in a history text without much in the way of interpretation . the irony is that he has been able to take far more internalized fictional characters , like the remains of the day's james stevens , and make them extraordinarily vivid . 
starring : anthony hopkins , matthew broderick , bridget fonda , john cusack , dana carvey , camryn manheim , lara flynn boyle , traci lind , michael lerner director : alan parker producers : alan parker , armyan bernstein , and robert f . colesberry screenplay : alan parker based on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle cinematography : peter biziou music : rachael portman released by columbia pictures the road to wellville dares to ask the question " when approached from the perspective of a period piece with a 'name' cast , can flatulence be funny ? " unfortunately for those stuck in the audience , it also provides the answer . for , while it's entirely possible to get a laugh or two out of this sort of relentless scatological humor , there's a point at which the bodily function jokes stop amusing and start aggravating . in the road to wellville , this happens about thirty minutes into the film , which is bad news because there's still an hour and a half to go . writer/director alan parker has designed this story , set in 1907 at the battle creek sanitarium , as a satire on all sorts of health and wellness issues . frequently , however , his more biting statements get swamped by " toilet humor . " there's only so much about the bowels that any audience can take - and here we get our fill , and more : " the bowels are born again , " " the bowels are our passage to health , " " clean thoughts make for clean bowels , " and " clean bowels make for clean thoughts . " all that , and enemas too . the film follows two parallel , yet rarely convergent plots . why this second , generally irrelevant subplot was included at all in the road to wellville is a question to ponder . not only does it draw out an already-overlong film , but it never dovetails with the primary storyline . when charles eventually shows up at the sanitarium , we expect some sort of closure , but nothing really happens . the first half-hour , which is moderately entertaining , passes relatively quickly . after that , however , the story's progression decelerates as tedium and inertia set in . by the end , it's hard to believe that you've only been in the theater for two hours . it seems significantly longer . the presence of anthony hopkins does not guarantee a good movie ( even those with short memories may recall the disastrous freejack , in which he played the villain ) , as is illustrated here . with buck teeth and wire-rimmed spectacles , hopkins invests a fair amount of energy in his portrayal of dr . kellogg , but nevertheless ends up seeming much like that part of the anatomy that the road to wellville is overly-enamored with . fine actors such as colm meaney and john neville are wasted in insignificant roles . ultimately , the road to wellville is just too long and pointless . it's a film without direction , and the script appears less concerned with coherence than with how to get a cheap laugh from a body noise . surprisingly , considering alan parker's involvement in the high-voltage the commitments , this picture is sadly lacking in energy . a more apt title might be the road to dullsville . 
director : ang lee . while watching the wedding banquet ( currently in limited release ) , i found myself thinking that it would have a very good short . this taiwanese-american comedy about generational and cultural conflict has fifty minutes of genuine energy stretched into an hour and fifty minute film . there are moments of real charm and insight , but ultimately the sluggish pace doesn't hold them together . ma and pa gao get a wedding , wei-wei gets a green card , and wei-tung gets a welcome tax write-off . complications . there are several thematic threads in the wedding banquet , all with interesting possibilities . foremost , there is the issue of living up to parental expectations which have nothing to do with who you are as a person . this latter area receives the most attention , but like the others it is given somewhat short shrift . director and co-scripter ang lee seems to want his film to be about too many different things , without giving sufficient attention to any of them . there are , as i've noted , some very clever set pieces . these individual moments almost add up , but they don't quite . much of the responsibility for this lack of engagement falls on the shoulders of the two male leads . chao , a first time actor , never invests wei-tung with any real depth . lichtenstein too is far too wooden , making simon's genuine frustration over having to hide himself come off as simple petulance . fortunately , there are good performances to somewhat balance theirs , most notably lung , who does some wonderful physical acting , and may lin , who sparkles as wei-wei . unfortunately , her character is sadly underwritten , as are most of the roles . the lulls in the pace would have been acceptable had strong characters been present to pull me along , but i was simply never caught up enough in their lives . it's difficult not to recommend the wedding banquet , since it's heart seems so firmly in the right place . it has its moments , and the themes of familial conflict may strike a chord with many viewers . however , i just never found myself caring quite enough , and i found myself looking at my watch too frequently . 
filmed by oliver curtis with a warm autumnal palate in color shades reminiscent of an old home movie , the film feels as old as its protagonist while the sets remind us that the picture is set in the present . giles hasn't " been to the pictures in quite some time . " the local newspaper calls it a " puerile romp without a single redeeming feature . " ( i'm sorry to report that i've seen a lot of those lately . ) the awful dialog from these videos will elicit many a chuckle from the audience even if no big laughs . " hey man , don't grief out on me . " ) a romance with a comic veneer , the touching film meanders along like a slow running brook with small delights , albeit no big ones , all along the way . typical of the movie's dry humor is the message that giles puts on his first-ever answering machine . the caller is instructed to leave a brief message , but only if it is extremely urgent . the unstated implication being that , otherwise , as giles would say , the caller should just " bugger off . " it is rated pg-13 for brief strong language , thematic elements and some sexual references and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . 
paul hogan as michael j . " crocodile " dundee is an apolitical braggart and a generally loveable character - just the sort you'd want to hang out with if you had a trip into the australian outback . although an extremely popular movie that garnered an academy award nomination for its script by hogan , john cornell , and ken shadie , the people associated with it were not able to build on their success in the movie . paul hogan had few other movie roles of merit and was last seen in the odious flipper remake . the writers and the director , peter faiman , similarly disappeared into oblivion . crocodile is totally at peace with nature , or as he puts it , " god and me , we'd be mates . " the incredulous new york native , who isn't used to strangers speaking , much less being friendly , is completely bewildered . rather than have the guy take offence , the big-hearted picture has him be surprised and curious rather than insulted . the innocence of this sweet little story is best seen when crocodile finds something looking like a foot washer in the bathroom in his fancy midtown hotel room . embarrassment - that's a concept not often seen in today's movies . it is rated pg-13 for a brief scene of ridiculed drug usage and for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 7 and up . my son jeffrey , age 9 , liked the movie and gave it * * 1/2 . 
the best of the bunch could win the prestigious hitchcock award , something that urban legends : final cut would have no chance of winning . why don't they make sequels of movies whose characters we would like to know more about -- the big chill , for example ? the original urban legend , which is pretty bad , is a decidedly watchable movie compared to its schlocky sequel . with a homogeneous group of young actors playing almost completely interchangeable characters , the movie is slapped together by its director ( john ottman ) and writers ( silvio horta , paul harris boardman and scott derrickson ) like a toddler with duplo blocks . as blood splatters everywhere , the film uses every clich ? in the horror movie writer's manual , from stupid victims to loud noises . there isn't an incident in it that you haven't seen done before , and frequently better . there is simply no reason to waste your money on this movie , which wouldn't be worth seeing if it were the only thing showing in town . if you want to see a good movie about urban legends , urbania , currently playing the art houses , covers this ground with style , even if the film is a thriller rather than a horror movie . if it's a horror movie you're after , perhaps the best ever made , the exorcist , complete with new footage and a new digital soundtrack , is currently playing at your local multiplex . it is rated r for violence , gore , language and some sexuality and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older . 
after seeing and being disappointed by the recent ( 1997 ) remake of that darn cat , we decided to go back and watch the original 1965 version starring hayley mills and dean jones . although dated , the original clearly outshines the remake . even the cat in the original possesses superior acting talent and a wider ranges of emotions . the book's authors as well as bill walsh are credited with writing the screenplay for the original . i have been told that the botched screenplay for the new version went through so many rewrites that the writers , s . m . alexander and l . a . karaszewski , tried to disassociate themselves from it . while no masterpiece , the script for the 1965 film evidences a certain charm . unlike the broad slapstick of the remake , the original has a gentler and more subtle humor , plus it takes the cat and the detective story more seriously . both stories share a common plot outline . ( the remake changes it so that the partial word becomes a profanity , and they make much of the fact that it is cuss word . whereas the new version has christina ricci as an apathetic teen , the original had the ever peppy hayley mills . whereas angst-ridden ricci tries to be unlikable , mills's cheerfulness and sweetness makes her eminently likable . kelso takes his job seriously , which actually makes the result funnier . the remake has doug e . doug as kelso , and he so overacts that it is embarrassing to watch him . jones does some slapstick in the original , but controls his acting . outlandishness by itself rarely provokes laughter . " i have the informant in sight , " radios one of the agent trackers . the more the agents believe , the better it works . the show has a strong supporting cast including william demarest , frank gorshin , roddy mcdowall , and ed wynn . they all contribute to several interesting subplots . my favorite part of the show ? the drive-in . she complains that " all the surfer movies are alike , " but they sit with their eyes glued to the screen anyway . the original that darn cat runs a little too long at 1 : 56 . it is rated g and contains nothing offensive . the movie is suitable for the entire family . my son jeffrey , almost 8 , likes both version , but prefers the remake . i hated the remake , but recommend the original and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
" it's my considered opinion that in the fullness of time , history will record the greatness of [michael] collins and it will be recorded at my expense . " not unexpectedly , writer/director neil jordan has been obligated to affirm the picture's integrity , stating at the toronto film festival that " most of the people who accuse me of inflaming the peace process have no interest in the peace process whatsoever . " in truth , while michael collins does distort elements of history , most of the changes and compressions are dramatically effective . certain characters are combined , a few deaths happen differently from what history records , and events have been streamlined . the usage of such " dramatic license " is not uncommon in the development of reality- based movies , so it shouldn't come as a surprise that it exists in this case . perhaps the most suspect element of michael collins' script is the negative portrayal of irish hero eamon de valera . partisans of the late president will not react favorably to such speculation , even though , in the context of this narrative , it works . putting aside all the controversy , however , viewers are left with an expertly-directed and well-acted historical epic that disappoints only in its shallow perspective of the irish/british and irish/irish conflicts . this is a case where the era not only defines the character , but the character defines the era . it's impossible to tell the tale of michael collins without delving into the beginnings of the ira and the dramatic upsurge in support for sinn fein , yet there's a sense that important issues have been glossed over . however , jordan's view of characters and circumstances is remarkably even-handed -- he shows both the brutality and sensitivity of collins' nature , turning the man into the central figure of an almost-shakespearean tragedy . strong acting is a key reason why michael collins is as effective as it is . his portrayal of collins is the most passionate , powerful work he has ever done , easily eclipsing his oscar-nominated presentation of oscar schindler . for well over a decade , neeson has been carefully honing his talents , and the results are apparent here . although neeson's forceful performance drives the movie , he is assisted by an able supporting cast . alan rickman , best known for playing flamboyant villains ( die hard and kevin costner's robin hood ) gives a surprisingly low-key and introspective interpretation of de valera . and , despite a variable irish accent , julia roberts is more than capable in the small role of kitty kiernan , the woman who brings collins' human side to the fore . even for those who know the whole story of michael collins , the movie is still a riveting piece of film making , capable of holding an audience's attention for more than two hours . jordan not only does an exceptional job recreating the ireland of the 1920s , but presents us with an entirely human protagonist who's flawed yet sympathetic . collins is not the brash hero of the traditional historical epic -- he's a tormented individual who knows that his chief talent is for creating mayhem , but who wants peace so desperately that he's willing to die for it . leeson's portrayal of collins' agony during the civil war is so real that , at times , it's almost painful to watch . in tone and spirit , if not in time and place , this film shares a great deal with last year's oscar-winning braveheart . neil jordan felt that this story was so important that he nurtured the script for thirteen years until he had the clout to command the actors and budget he wanted . the ultimate result may not quite match his ambitions , but it will still be one of 1996's most talked- about motion pictures . -- ingmar bergman 
take the mentality of an old-fashioned hollywood western , bleed in elements from kevin costner's dances with wolves , and start it out with a sequence culled from the fugitive , and you get the last of the dogmen--a surprisingly entertaining , somewhat corny adventure film . and , while there's an obviously politically-correct slant to the story , that does nothing to dilute the last of the dogmen's enjoyability . the movie isn't as accomplished as dances with wolves , but it doesn't have either the length or quite the same aspirations . it's not really all that complicated a story , but someone from savoy pictures disagreed , and the result is an extremely irritating voiceover read by an uncredited wilford brimley . i'm not fond of this method of storytelling in the best of circumstances , but this is easily the most intrusive and redundant narration in years . the last of the dogmen would have been vastly improved without it . just as you're really getting into the story , brimley's voice pops up to interrupt the flow . nevertheless , occasional plot contrivances aside , the last of the dogmen succeeds on several levels . despite a two-hour running length , the movie keeps the audience's attention . berenger and hershey work well together , and their budding romance remains low-key . the cinematography is gorgeous , with effective use of the exhilarating mountain scenery . it's almost possible to believe that a lost tribe could exist undetected out in that wilderness . and a shot of a high-flying airplane , reminding us that this is 1995 , is a nice touch . writer/director tab murphy pokes occasional fun at the macho cowboy image while simultaneously embracing it through berenger's scruffy lewis . this simple theme lies at the core of an adventure that , while not original , is nevertheless satisfying . the last of the dogmen may recall dances with wolves , but it seems less a copy than a different story taking a similar path . 
more later on why i say " somewhat . " it stars kathy bates as dolores claiborne in another one of bates brilliant acting performances . selena , likewise , is a walking time bomb of pent up anger about something . it was an interesting and effective editing technique . the two parallel stories work equally well , and thanks to the editing , they are interwoven nicely . the past has lots of abuse , violence , and major alcoholism . i was never quite sure the meaning of this while watching the show . a couple of days later it hit me why , and it made sense . if you see it and can not figure it out , i am not going to tell you the answer . you will have to keep pondering . actually , that you still think about a movie after you leave is a tribute to its effectiveness . the cinematography was certainly beautiful in the golden hues of sunset and in the glow of a solar eclipse . on the other hand , i felt it overpowered the story and would have been more appropriate in another movie . the scenes of dark and depressing grays were also overdone i thought . better to have the acting and the script convey the mood and have the cinematography complement it rather than overwhelm it . the acting was good around with one exception . he is too much of a nice guy , and it showed through . his evil was too one dimensional and was rarely threatening . a thriller needs a strong villain , and dolores claiborne had none . i attribute this problem solely to strathairn and to the directing ( taylor hackford ) and not to the script ( tony gilroy ) . having a weak villain relegated the movie to being somewhat of a thriller with a lightweight mystery attached . with a more effective bad guy , this movie could have really taken off . instead , it became more a character study , which was very effective , and a mood piece , which , as i already said , was overdone . dolores claiborne runs 2 : 11 , but it did not seem that long . it is correctly rated r for significant amounts of realistic domestic violence and for alcohol and drug abuse . i think it would be fine for mature teenagers . i recommend this movie to you , and i award it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
simply put , this is one of the best crime films ever made . especially considering that it was made on a budget of only $230 , 000 . it most closely resembles in style and scope the work of the great french directors jean-pierre melville and jacques becker , as a classic noir tale depicting man's foibles of greed and betrayal . the the robbery itself is told in multiple flashback style , as each character gets a chance to tell his version of the story , which is done in parts , so that each character's story is not only told but the film is able to jump back and forth in time , allowing for several events to happen together . she also clearly had the two best lines in the film : if people didn't have headaches , what would happen to the aspiren industry ? what makes this film so tense and gripping , is the exacting details that went into making this caper work , as it is seen through the eyes of the odd mixture of characters who commit the robbery . the point made , is a theme that kubrick will return to many times in his long career in films , that their perfect robbery fails because of the human condition they couldn't control and not because the robbery wasn't perfectly executed . it fits in with kubrick's notion of life : that it is vital for one to see how the pieces are played out on the chess board and how the player who does not always have the best strategy or execution can still win by learning how to persevere and change as the game does . as one of kubrick's early features , it remains one of his greatest films , even without the added visual dimensions he was to pour into his later high-budget , more complex movies . the outstanding cast made everything look natural , and the gritty realism of the story was only enhanced by the glorious b/w cinematography . 
saying that tin cup may be the best-ever " golf motion picture " isn't exactly high praise , considering the competition ( caddyshack , happy gilmore ) , but it's true nonetheless . in fact , as sports movies go ( regardless of the sport ) , this one turns in a respectable showing , injecting some intelligence and maturity into a story that easily could have succumbed to a flood of " struggling underdog " cliches . that's not to say that elements of the formula aren't here , but they rarely threaten to overwhelm tin cup's better aspects . when it comes to making sports movies , no one has shown more aptitude than ron shelton , whose writing and directing credits include films about baseball ( bull durham , cobb ) , basketball ( blue chips , white men can't jump ) , football ( the best of times ) , boxing ( the great white hype ) , and now golf . however , while romantic subplots are frequently used as side dishes for motion picture athletic contests , shelton keeps the two disparate elements of his movie on equal footing , which lends a sense of balance to the finished product . one of the most laudable characteristics of tin cup is that the script never condescends to either of the main characters . these aren't two mismatched caricatures engaging in a series of familiar romantic moves . crisp , thoughtful dialogue replaces the empty banter we've become accustomed to in screen love stories . there's a believability and depth to both kevin costner's roy " tin cup " mcavoy and rene russo's molly griswold , and the understated manner in which they relate to each other is a welcome change-of-pace during this season of loud , ostentatious explosions . and , while the chemistry between costner and russo doesn't sizzle , they work together in a comfortable , relaxed manner . to the men of salome , the concept of a female doctor is a revelation , and , in one of the film's more slyly amusing scenes , they watch eagerly as roy teaches her the basics of hitting a golf ball , wondering how " such a pretty girl can have such an ugly swing . " although this may sound like a very familiar , traditional sports movie , don't worry -- shelton applies enough tweaks and twists to the formulaic story to keep us interested and a little unsure of the outcome . tin cup isn't concerned with blazing new trails -- that's beyond its scope or ambition . instead , it's content to offer a pleasantly likable , gently comic two hours of simple life lessons , with golf as the obvious metaphor . as the saying goes , you don't have to appreciate the sport to enjoy the movie . this is the first such movie to boast cameos by top-notch players , including corey pavin , fred couples , and lee janzen . still , tin cup has a broad enough appeal that intimate knowledge of the joys and frustrations of playing 18 holes isn't necessary . this movie ranks as better-than-par entertainment . 
first , let me confess that i am a big shakespeare fan . i have loved most of the movies based on his plays , and franco zeffirelli's romeo and juliet and kenneth branagh's henry v are among my favorites of all the movies of any type that i've ever seen . sad to say , that othello proves that , with the poor direction , even shakespeare can be made boring . when i kept seeing the trailers for the movie , i wondered why there was little dialog shown . i now know why . first time director oliver parker has the actors read their lines slowly , softly , and without a hint of emotion . shakespeare on prozac . there is little to offend in the movie , but neither is there much to engage the audience . i will not cover the story here other than to say that the cast consists of laurence fishburne as othello , irene jacob as desdemona , kenneth branagh as iago , nathaniel parker as cassio , and michael maloney as roderigo . most of you probably already know the story . the surprise for me was the acting by laurence fishburne . i think he is awesome and have admired his work , especially what's love got to do with it and searching for bobby fischer . i am convinced that , with proper direction , he could have given a compelling and original rendition of othello . only kenneth branagh attempts to breath a little life into his character , but in the end he gives the worse performance of his career . his soliloquies to the audience are vapid . the director decided to have his actors attempt heavy italian accents . the thick accents coupled with the low delivery and the shakespearean language means it is very hard to follow the film . take along a cliff's notes with you if you go so you can keep up with it . on the other hand , the lack of energy parker gives the movie may put you to sleep before you get around to opening the pamphlet . at one point , iago says , " pleasure and action make the hours seem short " . and vice versa i thought to myself . there are many small things wrong with the movie . most of the costumes ( caroline harris ) are standard issue from the shakespeare part of the costume department , but the armor that othello wears in the beginning seems not to fit fishburne and overall just looks silly . the only thing done right in the movie is the cinematography ( david johnson ) . it is full of warm and realistic candlelit rooms . granted it is nothing unusual , but it is pleasant to watch . it is rated r for brief nudity and a little sex . a pg-13 rating might have been more appropriate . the scenes getting it the r rating added little and without them , the movie could have been pg . this movie would be fine for anyone over ten , but i can not see why people would want to waste their time at it . if you must see othello , then rent the franco zeffirelli directed film version of the opera with placido domingo staring in it . if you hate opera , then rent one of the other fine film adaptations of shakespeare's plays . i give this film one star because although it was boring , it was not painful . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : january 10 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
cast : zdenek sverak , andrej chalimon , libuse safrankova , ondrej vetchy , stella zazvorkova , ladislav smolijak director : jan sverak producers : eric abraham , jan sverak screenplay : zdenek sverak cinematography : vladimir smutny music : odrej soukup u . s . distributor : miramax films in czecholsavakian with subtitles yet , even with such world-shaping events happening in the background , kolya is still a deeply personal motion picture that has far more to do with the human soul than with the political restructuring of a country . even though kolya comes from eastern europe ( the director , jan sverak , is a member of the new wave of czech cinema ) , its message and intentions are universal in scope . the film's essential kernel -- one man's discovery of the importance of love by caring for a child -- has fueled numerous other films through the years in many different languages . recently , such diverse works as il ladro di bambini , ciao professore ! , and even last year's dimly-received bogus , have relied upon this theme . one of the reasons why kolya satisfies is that it effectively marries the metamorphosing political umbrella with the changes in louka's personal circumstances . essentially , this is a tale of new beginnings . without question , kolya is a beautifully composed motion picture ; there's an almost-poetic quality to the manner in which many of the scenes have been framed . the film also boasts a strong cast . zdenek sverak bears a resemblance to sean connery not only in appearance but in screen presence . complimenting him is young andrej chalimon , whose unaffected performance allows us to forget that we're watching an inexperienced actor . kolya represents miramax's first major foreign-language release of the new year , and , for those who aren't intimidated by subtitles , it offers a charming , warm-hearted evening of cinema . 
screenplay : duncan kennedy and donna powers & wayne powers . director : renny harlin . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 105 minutes . steven spielberg has said for years that one of the keys to the success of jaws was technical failure . the mechanical shark affectionately nicknamed " bruce " wasn't necessarily supposed to be a shadowy figure menacing the protagonists from the fringes of the frame -- he just didn't work right . bruce's frequent unannounced work stoppages forced spielberg to get more creative . the rest is a milestone in cinematic suspense history , further proof that real terror comes not from what we see , but from what we're afraid we're going to see . it would be easy enough to scoff at deep blue sea as a gloss on jaws that just doesn't " get it , " but that wouldn't be entirely fair . jaws , whether intentionally or made necessary by technical limitations , was a suspense film ; deep blue sea is an old-fashioned monster movie . the genre conventions are all terribly conventional , but director renny harlin stages them with methodical effectiveness . there are a few solid scares and one magnificently effective shock , the kind that leaves an audience giggling nervously for several seconds . there's even some cautionary nonsense about scientific hubris , in the fine tradition of frankenstein or the fly . it's what monster movies are supposed to do , and deep blue sea uses its trio of toothy villains to deliver the requisite armrest-gripping . if only anyone involved with the script had taken a second to go beyond the merely requisite . deep blue sea is full of half-completed characters doing generally stupid things . granted , the monster movie as we know it would not exist without people doing generally stupid things , but it's still frustrating to put up with them saying stupid things at the same time . the film gets even sloppier by positing not merely that the sharks have developed advanced intelligence , but that they have apparently studied physics and engineering , and had access to detailed schematic diagrams of the facility . there's only so far a film can involve you when it treats the viewers as though they're dumb and treats the characters as though they're chum . deep blue sea is , of course , following in some mighty big footsteps in the killer shark milieu , which makes it even more surprising that there are so many echoes of jaws and its sequels . it's almost as though harlin and company _want_ the film to be compared to jaws , as though they think they've one-upped the ultimate shark film . in the press notes , harlin says of jaws , " it's 25 years later , and audiences , accustomed to animatronics and computer-generated imagery , need to see more . " and perhaps he's right , but that still only makes deep blue sea a technically-proficient monster movie . as character-driven suspense , it bites off much more than it can chew . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i can't remember a film getting as much mileage out of a single visual gag as my giant gets out of its one and only visual gag . soon the unlikely pair are on the road together , every scene between them something that momentarily fools you into thinking there _must_ be some special effects at work . it's enough to make you wonder why they don't make silent films anymore , when this one could have been thoroughly enjoyable without a single character opening his or her mouth . crystal , for his part has always been good with a reaction take and a vaudevillian's sense for milking a laugh visually . saturday night and now my giant . david seltzer's script piles on the pathos so thick -- tender moments between sammy and his estranged wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , sad-eyed tete-a-tetes with his son ( zane carney ) , lillianna's rejection of max , a potentially life-threatening ailment for one main character -- that it threatens to crush everything in its path . the few decent jokes crystal manages to squeeze in between the heart-felt glances hardly seem worth the effort . muresan , meanwhile , is just too endearingly goofy not to look at , a great dane puppy in a peasant shirt . if you've seen his hilarious snickers commercial , in which he hawks an eponymous cabbage-cented cologne on a home shopping channel , you know muresan has charm and a surprising comic sense . you would also know that , compared to muresan's marble-mouthed diction , andre the giant sounded like he studied with henry higgins . it's an undemanding role , one in which muresan demonstrates infinitely more screen presence than fellow hoopster-cum-thespians like shaquille o'neal and michael jordan . you just can't help wishing that the big guy would continue to smile engagingly while embarking on fewer adventures into the english language . whatever its failings , my giant is almost worth watching simply for a few jaw-droppings cenes featuring steven seagal . playing himself on the set of an action movie where max might play the villain , seagal shows more willingness to poke fun at his image than i ever suspected he had in him . when his director asks if a scene could be better with one more take , a casually arrogant seagal answers , " no ; " when he makes a call to sammy's son as a favor , he allows the skeptical boy to mock his look ( " that stupid ponytail " ) , his acting ( " lessons . . . how about taking a few ? " ) and his muttered line-readings ( " are you going to go hang out with stallone so i can understand you _less_ ? " ) for five minutes , my giant is comic genius , and seagal deflates himself masterfully . my giant has its moments , but its generally such a tepid and non-threatening comedy that the moments can't add up to much . feel-good shmaltz like this works much better when you don't have to listen to the shmaltz being spelled out for you . call me old-fashioned , but i prefer to imagine a version of my giant made 70 years ago , where no precious speeches got in the way of chuckling at mis-matched protagonists . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : wolfgang petersen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 136 minutes . the amazing thing about sebastian junger's best-selling non-fiction book the perfect storm was that it created an enthralling , page-turning story out of two less-than-pulse-pounding subjects : fishing and weather . even more surprising , perhaps , was the manner in which he chose to make those subjects readable . rather than creating a de facto novel about the people involved in the events , junger dives into journalistic detail . he immerses the reader so completely in the hard lives of swordfishermen as a culture that it's never necessary for him to over-dramatize the individual lives he's focusing on . as for the weather , he is similarly successful at creating specifics out of generalities . for junger , tension and adventure came from the simple facts . instead , he chose melodramatic twaddle . it's not an easy job wittliff has taken on , because there's no obvious through-line for junger's account to take as a screen story . the book effectively conveyed the personal and physical toll exacted by a fisherman's life , and for a while it appears that wittliff is pointing the story in the right direction . the perfect storm could have been set up as a seafaring twister , with stick figure characters wrapped in cool meteorological special effects . this film , at least , has its heart in the right place . its dialogue , however , could not be more wrong , wrong , wrong . perhaps panicked over how to make a journalistic account " engaging " for viewers , the makers of the perfect storm apparently gave bill wittliff the following instructions for writing his characters : " imagine a particularly bad romance novel with a $100 million budget . " they say things like , " there's only love ; " they say things like , " you're heading right into the mouth of the monster ! ; " for all the verisimilitude wittliff pumps into the conversations , the fishermen might as well have spent two hours growling " arrgh , matey " to one another . if not for the thrillingly staged final hour , the perfect storm might have been a total loss . as it stands , it's just on the border of worth a look . director wolfgang petersen stages the andrea gail's perilous journey with the kind of tension that finds you pulling yourself into a ball in your seat ; there's also a strangely effective scene involving a mid-air refueling attempt for a rescue helicopter thwarted by the intense winds . it's purely visceral film-making , mind you , but it's very good visceral film-making , and at least you don't have to worry about listening to the next ridiculous thing to come out of someone's mouth . it's ironic , because the perfect storm had the potential to be a powerfully human story in spite of showy visual effects and adventure set pieces . instead , it's only worth watching for its visual effects and adventure set pieces . the storm itself is perfect ; the purple prose journey towards that storm makes you long for a bit more journalistic distance . or at least for someone to fiddle with the sound mix so the wind drowned out every word . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
jane austen's mafia , sometimes marketed more simply as mafia ! , is a comedic retelling of the godfather saga . with many of the sets made to look identical to the movie series it spoofs , the film has jokes that work best for those familiar with the godfather movies , but the humor is so broadly written that people who have forgotten the coppola films will still get it . in his last film role before his death , bridges looks tired and miscast . to be fair , the gags he is given , like getting stuck in the venetian blinds , are not much to work with . the script uses a series of sight gags that work at first , but the movie , heavy on the flatulence jokes , soon runs out of its own gas . during the first thirty minutes , the writers , jim abrahams , greg norberg and michael mcmanus , use one ridiculous gag after another to send the audience reeling . as the story gets longer , the jokes get staler and the writers fall back on gross-out humor like the world's biggest vomiting scene . most of the movie , however , is silly fun . when one joke , like spaghetti on a stick , doesn't work , the writers toss the audience a barrage of other gags in the hopes that something will strike the viewers' fancy . ( the filmmakers even had fun with the press by sending out two press kits . the first one had a cover in english , but the text was in italian . some of the best jokes are funny partly because they are so crude that you are embarrassed to be laughing . sounds ridiculous and is , but the director stages it with so much outlandish panache that the scene generated guffaws from the whole theater . and still others , as the guy who threw craps at the dice table by throwing a pair of , well , you guessed it , left our audience just staring . most of the dialog is not up to the physical humor but there are some funny lines . " but my legs were too long . " even if you hate the movie , stay through all of the crazy credits , where you get " fun facts " and a horoscope interspersed with the more traditional credits . it is rated pg-13 for crude jokes and comic violence and would be fine for kids around 11 and up . 
the others , brilliantly written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar , is the quietest movie of the year , with characters who rarely talk much above a whisper and with background sounds that are only a couple of decibels higher than dead silence . but don't worry , you won't miss anything since you'll be on the edge of your seat throughout the most spell-binding mystery since the sixth sense . for the longest time , amen ? bar keeps us unsure not only as to what actually is happening but also as to what kind of mystery it is . perhaps it's a ghost story . but it could be a psychological drama . then again , it might be something else entirely . as you watch it , don't get cocky . even if you think you have figured it out , you may be wrong in more ways than one . as one character remarks prophetically , " there are going to be some big surprises . " the central character in this fascinating thriller is nicole kidman in a great and creepily intensive performance . this is reminiscent of the way that haley joel osment managed to outdo bruce willis in the sixth sense . the events that unfold completely shake her confidence . and that is only the setup for this intriguing story . that's all i am going to tell you , which isn't much . this much i can guarantee , as you keep trying to guess where the story is headed , you will not be disappointed when it gets there . it is rated pg-13 for thematic elements and frightening moments and would be fine for kids around 12 and up , depending entirely on how well they can handle fear of the unknown . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
" you know the old saying that if you don't like the weather , just wait five minutes and it will change ? " " i honestly believe that with hard work we can get it down to 3 to 4 minutes . " glenn has a lot to be proud of . easily one of the best documentary putdowns ever was this is spinal tap from 1984 . i remember the show for christopher guest's line about his amplifier . you see , their rock band was louder , and a priori better , than any other because their volume knob went to 11 rather than merely 10 . as before , he has a leading role and cowrote the witty and intelligent script . this time his cowriter is eugene levy . guest directs the film as well , which illustrates his talents better than any other part he has in the picture . his comedic sense of timing combined with the hilarious script had me laughing so hard i thought i would burst . the film is in three acts with a delightful epilogue . the only criticism i have of the picture is that the second act drags some in comparison with the others . although his last production in blaine , a staged version of the movie backdraft , had some unfortunate technical difficulties that forced the fire department to be called in , he has created a special musical for the town's big event . the actors in his musical are every bit as bad as the actors in the movie are marvelous . their mannerisms are so excessively cute that the whole show could have been built around their characters . anytime either of them spoke , i started to giggle . julie carnahan's costumes for them feature iridescent running suits . the actors in the movie approach the comedy so earnestly that i kept finding myself beginning to take the fictional documentary as factual . the more serious they became , the funnier was the humor . and no one was more sincere than dr . pearl . the ridiculous musical with its tacky sets is reminiscent of the " springtime for hitler " musical in the producers , which remains as one of the funniest films ever made . the longest and best act of the movie is the third , which is devoted to the musical . in a movie this good it is hard to pick out a favorite part , but for me it has to be the one where corky shows us his movie memorabilia collection . certainly , andre and wally are the most improbable candidates for action figures imaginable . although i was sitting in a press screening with just four other people in the theater , i felt like clapping when the film ended . it is that good . a more delightful and good humored show i have not seen in a long time . it is incorrectly rated r for a couple of bad words . the film is a classic g picture and would be fine for kids of any age . i give the movie a strong recommendation and * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
this is my father is a family affair , and not just because its subject matter involves family ties . so warm and wonderful was the experience , evidently , that no one bothered to pay much attention to telling an interesting , coherent story . this is my father is a sprawling mess of a film that tries to tell several stories , each one more irritating than the last . the trouble begins in this is my father with a present-day prologue that does a miserable job of setting up the premise . in fact , the entire framing story feels like little more than a series of ridiculous contrivances . unfortunately , that romance is so ridiculously apocryphal that it's not clear until the last ten minutes which of two girls is supposed to be his own lovely lass . every moment set in the present is a wearying bore , leading this viewer to a stone-faced demand that the flashback sequences better be worth it . they're not . they're an improvement , to be certain , but there's so much extraneous business going on that the central romance gets lost . the romance itself ultimately makes no sense from fiona's side , with nary an attempt to explain why the spunky girl would be charmed by the socially inept kieran . aidan quinn fares better as a man-child unsure how to handle a romantic relationship , but the story places too much tragic weight on his shoulders . they may have been most interested in re-creating the sights and sounds of 1939 ireland . the problem is that you really can't tell what they wanted to do with any degree of certainty . this is my father never pulls its two storylines together in any believable way , nor manages to make either one gripping on its own terms . the filming may have served as a pleasant , roots-exploring quinn family vacation , but we the viewers are left with the tedium of watching their home movies . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : danny devito , gregory hines , stacey dash , kadeem hardison , khalil kain , marky mark , james remar , cliff robertson director : penny marshall producers : sara colleton , elliot abbott , and robert greenhut screenplay : jim burnstein cinematography : adam greenberg music : hans zimmer released by touchstone pictures that's generally not a bad thing and , as far as motion pictures are concerned , it has its place . unfortunately , renaissance man is far from the director's best effort . in fact , it's like someone injected a dash of bitter lemon to the confection . there are problems , however ( there have to be , otherwise there wouldn't be a movie ) . taken as a whole , renaissance man is a typical offering from the director . it's about earning mutual respect , righting wrongs , and enjoying a too-sappy happy ending . however , along the way , this movie wanders , never offering much insight into any of the characters , relying on poorly-concealed plot devices , and manipulating with a surprising heavy-handedness . the feel is not right , and it has as much to do with the movie's failed attempt to deal with too many individuals as with its overlong running time . one of the first rules of storytelling , whether it's through cinema or another medium , is " show , don't tell . " as if hearing a poignant snippet is going to create an immediate emotional attachment . . . . while the circumstances of shakespeare's introduction into the classroom are forced , once the students get into the bard's work , there are some worthwhile moments ( including a lively rap synopsis of hamlet ) . there's not enough content for renaissance man to function as a cliffnotes , but those familiar with the plays shouldn't have any problem following along . what saves renaissance man is its cast . from danny devito and gregory hines on down , everyone turns in a fine performance . while all of the actors portraying students are convincing , a couple are worth singling out . stacey dash , who plays miranda myers , the only female member of bill's group , is tremendous , combining energy , sex appeal , and intelligence in a lively mix . marky mark , hitherto known only as a " personality " , proves that he can actually do some acting . his low-key style is oddly reminiscent of that of a young tommy lee jones . renaissance man is a movie of moments , too many of which are mediocre or unfulfilling . feel-good movies are a staple of summer viewing , and in order to succeed with one , there has to be enough originality to transcend the run-of-the-mill product . this film , with its total predictability , misses the bullseye . a bad penny marshall picture still has appeal , but renaissance man is a disappointment , and far from the best that's available . 
the telltale signs were all there . yes , you guessed it . in brian wayne peterson's script , which abides no subtle moments , megan's true sexual orientation is never left in question . director jamie babbit could use some of john waters's deft touch with comedy . the movie's satire is relegated to the visuals , with rachel kamerman's kitschy set decoration and alix l . friedberg's colorfully silly costumes providing almost all of the humor . the one-joke movie is cute but rarely funny . the first time we see the true direction outfits -- shocking pink for the girls and iridescent blue for the boys -- they are funny . but the uniform jokes quickly wear thin . the film's quality test , on which but i'm a cheerleader fails miserably , is what would the movie be like without the outlandish sets and costumes . the answer is that there wouldn't be much left . but i'm a cheerleader runs just 1 : 21 . it is rated r for strong language and sexual content involving teens and would be acceptable for high school seniors . 
lazenby makes the mistake of trying to imitate connery rather than giving his own interpretation to the role , and as we all know , imitations just make us yearn for the genuine article . lazenby , an exceedingly plain looking actor devoid of much personality , lacks connery's handsome face as well as his suave demeanor . he went on to appear in the television soap opera " general hospital " and in many minor films . but , thankfully , he never again attempted the travesty of acting the bond role . ( bond films titillate with hints of nudity and sex while showing neither . the line pokes fun at the switch but also serves to remind us that our old favorite is gone . ( connery will be back two more times as james bond , something we didn't know or even suspect when this movie first played . ) she's so much smarter than lazenby than she seems out of place . even without make-up or fancy clothes her natural beauty dominated the room like a thick perfume . ) when lazenby , as bond , quits in a huff early on in the film , one feels like applauding in the vain hope that connery will return forthwith -- the applause being motivated as much by wanting to dispose of lazenby and his lackluster performance as by getting our old hero back . the story's plot reeks of triviality . spectre's #1 , played this time without much energy by telly savalas rather than the much better donald pleasence , runs an exclusive allergy institute high atop a private , snow-covered mountain . richard maibaum's script doesn't tell us much about spectre's plans until the last third of the movie . that is , unless spectre gets a huge payoff . we're still waiting , however , for thunderball-style personal jetpacks to be available at sharper image . the show has several technical problems . " i hope i can live up to your high standards , " bond says at one point . well , lazenby couldn't and didn't . it is rated pg for violence and sexual innuendo and would be fine for kids around nine and up . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , liked this movie but still likes thunderball the best . he did not like lazenby at all , and he thought the new actor playing spectre's #1 was not creepy enough . he has seen the first 6 bond films now , and he likes this one least of all . 
screenplay : shuki levy and shell danielson . directors : david winning and shuki levy . mpaa rating : pg ( violence , mild profanity ) running time : 100 minutes . you've got to hand it to saban entertainment , keepers of the power rangers franchise . in the notoriously fickle business of children's entertainment and merchandising , the rangers have survived by changing just enough to keep their young fans interested . costumes have been updated ; new iterations of action figures have filled the shelves . even characters have been replaced in rejuvenating line-up changes , making the rangers akin to a super-powered menudo . yet the most misguided changes to date have been those in 1995's lifeless mighty morphin power rangers : the movie , which substituted high-tech hardware for low-tech charm . turbo : a power rangers movie is still dopey kiddie fare , but it's an improvement over mmpr : tm by orders of magnitude , with a couple more changes still up its sleeve . it can be a monumental effort for anyone over 12 to make it through power rangers material , simply because it is so steadfastly simplistic . robot side-kick alpha , and the plots are elemental fantasy tales with an " afterschool special " moral usually tacked on somewhere . turbo adds to the mix a lovable little character who can heal with a touch and can't survive long on earth . . . no , not e . t . , but an incredible simulation in the muppet-faced lerigot . the formula is so unshakeable in its blandness that , within the context of the rangers universe , the twists turbo serves up can only be described as ingenious . it's also nice to have someone repeating the rangers' morphing mantra of " awesome ! " who doesn't sound like an immature nit-wit while doing it . the appearance is good for a gasp of recognition from long-time ranger watchers , but it also gives the characters a dose of personality they never had as heroes . kimberly and jason actually spend most of their screen time trying to break out of the cargo hold of divatox's ship , and those scenes are surprisingly well-crafted and tense . for an action film designed for children , turbo is actually rather restrained , with more emphasis on suspenseful escapes than special effects-laden free-for-alls . directors david winning and shuki levy are working with some pretty limp material , but they make the most of it . they also correct the fatal flaw of the first power rangers feature by dumping the computer-generated zords and making the final megazord-vs . -megademon battle what it always should be : a battle of two guys in big rubber suits . turbo is unquestionably more fun for kids than for adults , but it is put together with some care , and it's a step in the right direction . day the ever-evolving rangers might morph into a movie franchise worth watching . 
screenplay : philip eisner . producers : jeremy bolt , lawrence gordon and lloyd levin . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , gore , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 95 minutes . give this to the makers of event horizon : as wholesale rip-offs of alien go , this one is remarkably thorough . in that sense , the malevolent entity a bit more efficient than the predatory stowaway of alien -- instead of tearing out your organs , it makes you want to tear them out yourself , or tear out those of your fellow crew members . event horizon , on the other hand , is not nearly so efficient . alien grabbed its viewers with one graphic , horrific moment and a whole lot of creepy atmosphers ; event horizon counters with a little creepy atmosphere and a whole lot of graphic , horrific moments . not a single violent image is left to the imagination , not when special effects can render a character coughing up blood in zero gravity , or a body ripped open and hung like a side of beef . there are certainly a few scares in event horizon , but director paul anderson ( mortal kombat ) rarely earns them . give me a roll of film , a dark room , a scary mask and a burst of dissonant strings , and even i could get an audience to jump every time . event horizon doesn't build a sense of dread , because it's easier to settle for shock and disgust . the truly disappointing thing about philip eisner's script is that , for a while , it looks like it's headed somewhere interesting . the idea of characters defeated by their own demons is infinitely more compelling than characters defeated by real demons , which gives event hroizon a creepy tension while there's still some mystery about what's going on . even when he does follow up on a character's motivations , they end up making very little sense . weir's motivations in particular -- which initially seem perfectly logical -- disintegrate near the film's climax , right about the time event horizon becomes a parade of explosions , slow-motion and lovingly photographed corpses . event horizon boasts some genuinely impressive technical credits , including imaginative production design by joseph bennett , but that doesn't explain what a cast this talented saw in this project . alien was the kind of memorable film which launched careers . event horizon is the kind of re-cycled nonsense which can end careers . remember , in space , no one can hear you scream , but in a movie theater , you can hear everyone groan . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
part biography , part social autopsy , and part movie criticism , from the journals of jean seberg is a fascinating perspective of the life and films of the star of joan of arc , bonjour tristesse , lillith , and paint your wagon . " most of my movies were mediocre , but i was in one or two great ones , " confides seberg at the beginning of this odyssey . it's a concise judgment of a career that has been forgotten by almost all but the most ardent film-goers . seberg burst on the movie scene in 1957 , when , at the age of 17 , she beat out 3000 contenders for the title role in otto preminger's epic biopic , joan of arc . the movie was , to put it mildly , a disappointment , due in large part to seberg's horrible miscasting . few people saw the movie , but among those who did was jean luc godard , who instantly wanted seberg for 1959's breathless . breathless and 1964's lillith , the chronicle of a woman's slow and sure descent into madness , represented the heights of seberg's uneven career . after those films , she appeared in a number of awful-to- middling pictures , often as a nymphomaniac . her swansong screen appearance in 1976 was in a nondescript role in a virtually-forgotten picture called the wild duck . from the journals of jean seberg draws parallels between seberg , jane fonda , and vanessa redgrave . at times , this parallelism seems forced , but it leads to a number of interesting observations about fonda and redgrave . despite generous heapings of gossip and indisputable fact , the most interesting aspect of jean seberg may be the film criticism . rappaport thoroughly dissects at least five of seberg's films ( joan of arc , bonjour tristesse , breathless , lillith , and birds in peru ) , offering commentary of the depth and insight that is typically found in only the most exhaustive critical essays . rappaport also offers an opinion of what made seberg unique -- according to him , she was the first actor to stare blankly back at the camera . jean seberg's social viewpoint is indisputably cynical . it's a vivid , feminist perspective that strikes more than a few raw nerves because of its acuteness . there are some aspects of seberg's career that perhaps deserved more screen time , and certain tangents ( such as one focusing on fonda ) that could have been reduced or eliminated . on the whole , however , this may be 1996's most unique motion picture to date , and is certainly one of the most innovative pseudo-biographies ever to reach the screen . 
it is distinguished by mamet's sharp dialogue and a cast that is just outstanding . the edwardian-aged story is chocked full of sensibility and rife with a tautness to it that keeps you fully tuned into its dramatics . the the film version of that event takes liberties with the real story . he turns out to be a better and more feeling lawyer than what catherine expected of him , which adds even more weight to the already intriguing story . its legal theme " let justice be done " really equates in this particular case to doing the right thing legally , which is acquitting the youngster . nigel hawthorne was simply brilliant in this role , conveying an urbane wit and a strong backbone for taking on the fight for a cause he believes in with all his heart . this is just a wonderful and an almost flawless film ( the only flaw : the likable family seemed so smug with their upper-class status ) . david mamet has done a masterful job in directing someone else's words to its fullest potential . on paper , the outline for this story and its denouement , do not suggest how great a work this film turned out to be . even its old-fashioned story is more modern than it first appears to be . don't miss this one . you might have to wait a long time before you find a film with both a family and a lawyer portrayed in such a genuine and likable mold . it was delightfully startling to watch the nuances every character performed , as they held their emotions in check by their keen intellect . yet what came through even more than their perseverance , was that underneath , in their bellies , there were all sorts of emotions taking place that we could see overtly in their character . 
these simple episodes are all admirable but rarely engaging . and , although the movie comes in at a mere 78 minutes , 10 would have sufficed . after about 3 minutes , each of the stories has made its rather straightforward point quite gracefully . the next 20 minutes of each adds little other than needless reinforcement . the mullah , in the story's only memorable line , calls her bicycle , " the devil's mount . " toloui's acting is exquisite , showing her pain and determination with eye expressions alone . it's always hard understanding someone else's religion , but the images shown of islam in this picture give one a feeling of sad repression . and it is the images alone that stay with you after this film is over . the film is in farsi with english subtitles . it is not rated but would probably be a g since there isn't anything offensive . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
i don't think any american filmmaker in my lifetime has had his personal life as closely associated with his films as woody allen . the compulsively auto-analytical allen created a classic film persona , but he also created a monster : a body of work constantly being read for clues about its creator . at first , it may sound like another apologia for the artist as world-class clod , a la deconstructing harry , but there's actually something more going on in the character of emmet ray . if he's not the best there is at his art , he may not be able to justify his self-imposed isolation from emotional connection . i'm coming to believe that sean penn may be the most talented american actor alive . penn does so many things right as emmet that it suddenly becomes evident that allen doesn't quite know how to handle it when an actor can make his script seem irrelevant . the light-hearted structure , with jazz scholars commenting talking-head style on emmet's misadventures , becomes jarring and distracting as emmet's story unfolds . episodes like emmet's attempt to con an amateur talent contest or his role in a botched hold-up ( told in three possible variations ) feel like forced attempts at giving the film a woody allen sensibility . only when allen holds penn unexpectedly in the dead center of a reaction shot -- a crucial exchange with another character where you'd usually expect a cutaway -- does it appear the director understands what he has working for him . samantha morton has also received plenty of praise for her role as a mute laundress with whom emmet has a lengthy relationship , and it's certainly an impressive physical performance . it's also clear how much morton is contributing to the story when she leaves the story , only to be replaced as primary romantic interest by the gratingly mannered uma thurman . but this is a jazz odyssey that works thanks to a stunning lead performance of a fascinating character , in spite of a structure always on the verge of sabotaging that character . you might suspect that the notoriously private allen was using sweet and lowdown as a first attempt to really open himself up emotionally on screen , but found it so awkward that he had to keep telling jokes . or maybe he's just an imperfect filmmaker who cast a great actor in an imperfect film . naaaaahhhh . . . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
and , although the play is an historical allegory for the mccarthy period , its true power lies in its ability to be re-interpreted to fit any time period . indeed , its fertile themes -- the lure of power , the gullibility of those who believe they have a moral imperative , the need to accept responsibility for the consequences of all actions , and the nature of truth -- are universal in scope . events such as those depicted in " the crucible " have recurred with alarming predictability throughout human history . scholars can argue about which of miller's two best plays ( " the crucible " and " death of a salesman " ) is the stronger work , but there's little doubt that " the crucible " is the most accessible . oddly , this is the first english-language motion picture version . with miller handling the screenwriting , it comes as little surprise that the crucible is faithful to its source material . those unaware of the film's background may be surprised to learn that such a dynamic production began life in the theater . miller has never claimed that his story is historically accurate , although many of the broader strokes correspond to events that actually occurred in salem , massachusetts during 1692 . one of the most contemporarily relevant aspects of the crucible , the ease with which justice can be manipulated and perverted , is what hytner and miller have chosen to highlight in this adaptation . a parallel-yet-integral theme relates to the thrill of power inherent in being the manipulator . as thematically rich as the crucible is , it would be a dry and uninteresting piece if the characters and their situations were less compelling . indeed , the human interest and drama of the story are what distinguish it . in the crucible , there are heroes and villains , but nothing is black and white . shades of gray permeate every action . much has been made of winona ryder's performance , but , while she does an excellent job fleshing out abigail as more than a cardboard instrument of vengeance and evil , two other actors captured my attention more forcefully . the first , perhaps unsurprisingly , is daniel day- lewis , whose john proctor takes on the dimensions of a classically- flawed tragic hero . graves' interpretation is wrenching , and deserves to be recognized alongside the performances of ryder and day-lewis . whether on stage or on film , " the crucible " is a powerful , thought- provoking production . this version illuminates the story's numerous strengths , resulting in a motion picture of surprising emotional and intellectual impact . by re-interpreting this classic so effectively , hytner has assured that at least one version of " the crucible " will become a part of film history . 
it is an elegantly sentimental work touching on the rituals observed on an army post . those were indeed more simplistic times , but not totally out of the realm of how some modern day soldiers may feel . the twists in the story line come from the quirks the characters display not from the story itself , which is rather ordinary : the comraderie between the captain and the very irish top sergeant ( mclaglen ) , who likes a bit of whiskey and adds comic relief to the stodginess of the army routine , fits in with the buddy theme of many ford films . a virtue that is considered essential for any character in a ford movie , that he really cares about . it adds to the feeling that the past cannot be ignored . winton hoch , the cinematographer , won an oscar for the visually memorable mesas and haunting loneliness of the monument valley landscape , which was used as the film's location sites . it provides the film with an epic scale of the country , as there is a melancholy intermingled in those vistas with a sense of reverie for the men who are so far away from civilization , surrounded by the red sand and barren mountain peaks , yet are greater practitioners of civilized etiquettes than even the citizens back east , through their daily obediance to rank and order and their need to socialize by formal dance and their chilvary toward women , which might seem old-fashioned but is pleasantly accomplished here . what pulls the film together and gives it a raw power , is something that can only be ascertained by accepting ford's premise that it is absolutely necessary what the men do and that they are in the right . to scrutinize this film in any other way , is to lose track of what direction the film meant to be going . to add color and more sentimentality to the story , there is the theme song of the yellow ribbon , played countless times , either to the immense pleasure of most viewers or to some , to grate on their nerves . the calvary should follow them to their reservations , but stay out of sight so the indians wouldn't be humiliated by the men watching them . this is ford's look at the west and the cavalry men he adores so much . perhaps the scene that summarizes the film's intentions best , is when wayne is given a solid silver watch by the men for his retirement , and the presenting of the gift and the accepting of it , are met with a few well-chosen words , each weighed heavily with an aura of mutual respect , almost bringing tears to wayne's and the audience's eyes , as he reads the inscription that you know means so much to him . if you can see that as a glorious and magnificent scene , you will have , most likely , fallen in love with this grand and lyrical film . but if you don't , you can still be swept away by the eloquence of the film and its call for some kind of majesty of action one should have , in this beautiful , god created country , that ford believes has room in it for everyone who acts civilly . 
sometimes you can learn a lot about a film from its ad campaign . the television spots for romeo is bleeding featured a high energy , rapid-edit montage which made the film look like an all-out action thriller ; the print ads , on the other hand , featured stylized renderings of the stars in a scene out of a 50's crime comic , with critical blurbs in word balloons . and that about sums up what's wrong with romeo is bleeding . there's a fair amount of style and black-humored mayhem , but underneath it is a film that really doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a noir thriller or a parody of a noir thriller , and a script that is an absolute mess . stylistically , romeo is bleeding seems to be on the right track . the lighting is evocative , the air is usually thick with cigarette smoke , and trumpets and saxophones wail plaintively in the background . a running voice-over narrative by jack , told in retrospect and in the third person , achieves the right raymond chandler-esque tone of impending doom . the stage is set to have some fun with film noir conventions--the dumb blonde girlfriend , the urbane mob boss--but that's not what happens . what does happen is that medak and screenwriter hilary henkin decide to serve up a freaked-out combination of 1940s and 1990s crime film sensibilities , sort of a " what if quentin tarantino and abel ferrara collaborated on a phillip marlowe adaptation . " consequently , the tone of romeo is bleeding is radically uneven , with moody conversations slamming into blood-spattered confrontations , and characterizations which don't make a shred of sense . the only logic in romeo is bleeding is the logic of excess , as the filmmakers abandon all pretense of telling a story in the name of the outrageous . structurally , the script for romeo is bleeding is a disaster . jack is developed in a careless , haphazzard manner that left me without any concern for what happened to him . finally , romeo is bleeding commits perhaps its most unpardonable sin with a final showdown between jack and mona which was so anti-climactic that i groaned out loud . at times , the film seems to have been improvised , as though in the middle of shooting someone would periodically say , " hey , wouldn't it be cool to do this ? " romeo is bleeding looks good , occasionally very good , and olin's performance is entertaining , but the film also appears to have been edited with a knife and fork , and amounts to little more than a series of loosely connected scenes with shock value . 
cast : jon lovitz , tia carrere , louise fletcher , mekhi phifer , malinda williams , guillermo diaz director : hart bochner producers : david zucker , robert locash , and gil netter screenplay : david zucker & robert locash and pat proft cinematography : vernon layton music : ira newborn u . s . distributor : tristar pictures these days , whenever a new picture comes out with one of the old zucker-abrams-zucker crew's name attached to it , it's easy to wax nostalgic for films like airplane ! those mvoies may not have been comic masterpieces , but at least they were consistently funny , which is more than can be said for high school high , the latest product to come off of david zucker's script-by-numbers comedy assembly line . this film bears more of a resemblance to such duds as don't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood and loaded weapon one than it does to any inventive parody . put simply , high school high isn't just bad , it's very bad . what else can i say about a movie that drags on for 85 minutes without delivering a single solid laugh ? as part of a comedy ensemble , lovitz can be quite funny , but it's apparent here that he is incapable of carrying a film on his own . his whiny antics quickly grow tiresome , and it doesn't take long before we start to dislike his character . he's not exactly supported by a strong comic cast , either . i won't attempt to explain the presence of distinguished shakespearean actor john neville ( the adventures of baron munchausen ) , except to say that a paycheck is a paycheck . high school high attempts to lampoon movies like the blackboard jungle , lean on me , and dangerous minds , but the only thing it succeeds in doing is illustrating the satirical bankruptcy of the production team . without exception , the jokes are way too obvious . if you play the " guess the punch line " game , you'll rarely be wrong . of course , predictability isn't the lone problem , because the spontaneous comedy doesn't work , either . the sight gags simply aren't funny , or even clever , and the verbal barbs are disappointingly tame . at least glen campbell fans have a reason to rejoice -- this is the first time i've heard " rhinestone cowboy " played since its heyday at the top of the charts . had the movie been amusing , it would have been easy to forgive the throwaway plot , but , since the humor is so feeble , the lack of a credible storyline becomes a huge disadvantage . ( ironically , in the production notes , the film makers state that they're proud of the film's depth . regarding high school high , that statement has to be the biggest joke of all . ) actually , all things considered , this year's the substitute ( one of the films supposedly spoofed here ) , which was mostly intended to be serious , contains more laugh-generating material than high school high . this brand of mindless comedy has passed the point where it offers more than minimal entertainment . even graded on a liberal curve , there's no way high school high can score better than an " f " . -- ingmar bergman 
no longer . strictly speaking , the film in neither a satire nor a black comedy , but there are heavy shadings of each woven into the narrative . . . . and justice for all's bleak , absurd look at lawyers would be hilarious if it wasn't so true-to-life . in the past twenty-five years , there have been countless courtroom dramas , most of which have tended towards the sensationalistic side of mediocre . . . . and justice for all is not one of those movies . although some of the action takes place in court , including one of the best-known trial sequences in the history of film ( pacino screaming , " you're out of order ! the movie is more about morality and ethics than courtroom shenanigans . . . . and justice for all has no part in the stock trade of shock witnesses and surprising revelations . the more you consider . . . and justice for all's message , and the means by which it is delivered , the more aware you become of how uncompromising jewison's attack is on the legal system . and those who genuinely care about their clients are foiled at every turn by the deeply-rooted hypocrisy and cynicism that defines american law . however , of all his oscar nominations , this is probably the least-deserved . pacino's intensity is undeniable , but the actor , who always works on the seam between restraint and overacting , crosses the line a few times too often . certainly , there are times when pacino is excellent , but he is not consistently so . of the supporting performers , john forsythe and jack warden leave the strongest impressions . there's nothing vaguely human about him except his capacity for vice . whether guilty or innocent of rape , he's still a villain . . . . and justice for all ends with the kind of bravura outburst by pacino that one might easily assume is designed to entice cheers and applause from the audience . but there's a subtle difference between this finale and the cornball conclusion of a later pacino picture , scent of a woman , which also featured a dynamic speech . here , the actor's words radiate real outrage , and what he says caps the film's central ethical dilemma about a lawyer defending a man he knows to be guilty . this is a powerful , cathartic moment that's neither exhilarating nor uplifting . like most of what precedes it , the climax of . . . and we need look no further than last year's #1 television event , the o . j . simpson trial , to understand everything that this film is trying to say . 
starring : kevin costner , clint eastwood , t . j . screenplay : john lee hancock . director : clint eastwood . let's face it , kevin costner hasn't become one of the most popular movie stars in the world because he can act the hell out of a part . sure , he's been charming enough in light fare like silverado and bull durham , but he's done little to prove that his ideal dramatic role wasn't as the corpse in the big chill . it therefore might not seem to mean much to say that a perfect world features costner's best all-around performance yet , and indeed it's nothing earth-shattering . however , it's more than solid , and coupled with an impressive turn by 7-year-old t . j . lowther creates a haunting story that packs a real punch even through its superfluous subplot . it seems in the early stages that he's setting up a parallel , or is interested in creating a hunter-hunted conflict a la the fugitive , but neither reall proves true . instead we get cliche'd characters in cliche'd conflicts . there's an icy fed to get on red's nerves , and plenty of pithy good ol' boy wisdom dispensed . eastwood and dern toss off token lines of good-natured antagonism , but neither one is interesting enough to make their story at all significant . a tighter , potentially classic drama might have come from chopping their segments entirely , because the main plot is a gem . the relationship between butch haynes and philip perry is one of the most unique and interesting explored in recent years . while at first glance butch might seem to be a simple " victim of a negative environment " type , he's more complicated than that . the picture that develops of his father is far from clear , making butch a less than reliable narrator . costner captures a surprising amount of nuance in his portrayal of butch , one minute the doting father , the next an edgy psychotic . it's a radical change of pace for costner , and he pulls it off . perhaps the larger credit for a perfect world's success is t . j . lowther . he's not asked to say much , but his expressive face becomes one of the most vital elements in the film . the relationship between butch and philip is the heart of a perfect world , and it's nearly perfectly executed . director eastwood's first outing since his oscar for unforgiven is a similarly dark piece about a struggle for redemption , and while the whole may not be as strong as last year's best picture winner , some of the moments are even better . the opening sequence is instantly gripping , and a long shot of butch and philip walking through a field , the boy repeatedly attempting to hold the criminal's hand , is wonderful . the best sequence comes near the end , as an idyllic waltz quickly turns into a remarkably intense confrontation . eastwood draws out the ending a bit too long , but by that point i was more than willing to stick with butch and philip . a perfect world is really two films . one is mediocre at best , but the other is one of the best films of the year . together , they still add up to one of the better films of the year . a note to inside joke watchers : look for a billboard for " bull durham tobacco " in the sequence at friendly's store . 
it's a decidedly corny and manipulative coming-of-age film that never quite grabbed my attention , but it was sure pleasant enough in a surface way , telling an old-fashioned story that carefully skirts any controversy . he says he took a job as an accountant so he would be sitting at work and people wouldn't notice that he walks with a limp . the coming-of-age messages in this film are presented in a low-key manner , as they reflect on a number of things seen through the childish eyes of willie , such as the pains of war , the disappointments of hero worship , the importance of friendship and loyalty , the thrill of puppy love , the necessity for community pride , the need for parental love and racial tolerance , and his overall fond memories of childhood . in a formulaic scene using every ounce of its energy to tear at the viewer's heart , skip wakes up after a life-saving operation , as an immense relief comes over the face of willie . the film should be enjoyed by children of all ages , as the dog steals the picture with his antics and spinning tricks and playful ways . adults might be taken in by a sense of nostalgia , about seeing an idealized childhood they might have had or wished for . those who grew up having a dog as a pet , should respond with approval about how much fun it was to have a dog . for the film to be better received , it would have needed more drama . but , as it is , it is good enough as a plain old-fashioned story about the love affair between an introspective youngster and his loving dog . muniz made for an appealing youngster , skip stole every scene he was in , and the understated and elegant performances by both bacon and lane , gave the film some life . if you're in the mood for a lighthearted boy-dog story and are not looking for anything deeper than that , then " my dog skip " will jump right up on your lap and lick your face . 
nevertheless , the love the sisters have for each other shines through this adversity . georgia ask sadie , " what are you drinking ? " , and sadie replies , " you know me . whatever is cheap or free . " sadie is an awful singer with a scratchy and irritating voice . during her first long song , people started piling out of my audience and heading to the lobby for refills . there is one long songfest that she has towards the end that made me want to jump up and scream " cut ! " this part reminded me of part of one of my favorite movies , the big chill . we're all scared and there are more of us all the time . " she keeps getting frailer and frailer throughout the movie . toward the end , i was ready to cry she was so sad . and yet , this movie is not a downer . at its heart and soul it is about intense sisterly love . jennifer jason leigh's performance is riveting . my only criticism of her acting is that when sadie is sober her mannerism do not change . mare winningham has a hard role to shine in , but she is up to it . the chemistry between the two of them is genuine and believable . sadie's heavy black eye make-up gives her both a wasted and a trendy look . the script ( barbara turner ) is written smart and insightful . i thought i had the ending figured out , but i didn't . finally , much credit has to go to the highly controlled directing by ulu grosbard . it is correctly rated r for heavy alcohol and drug abuse , bad language , some nudity , and a little sex . it is a very serious show that would be appropriate only for mature teenagers . this movie is filled with riveting performances , and i recommend it to you . it gets * * * from me . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : january 15 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
long before its release , fox's anastasia was greeted with some strangely familiar skeptical remarks . " the execution of the romanovs ? " " not exactly the stuff for an animated film , is it ? " similar words greeted disney's pocahontas a couple of years ago , and that film went on to take a criticaly pasting for not being enough " fun . " journalists and studios have formed an odd tag-team perpetuating the notion that an animated film with adult subject matter is just a waste of time between the happy meal characters . while television has produced smart animation for grown-ups like " the simpsons , " " king of the hill , " " dr . it's like folks don't like their cartoons gettin' uppity . anastasia is not , i repeat , _not_ a great film for kids . it is , however , a visually rich and extremely well-constructed story which shows a little nerve . at its least inventive , anastasia attempts merely to follow the successful disney plan for animated features . most of the comic relief shows up during rasputin's scenes , yet they also hinder the narrative . the villain doesn't contribute to anastasia's most interesting elements ; he's around because , darn it , you've _got_ to have a villain around in an animated film . that assumption is based on the " kids first " paradigm , one which anastasia doesn't follow most of the time . the characterizations of anya and dmitri are effective without being over-wrought ; their developing relationship is sketched out in smart , subtle scenes . the character animation seems somehow richer than most of disney's recent efforts , giving the characters more life ( anya's unconventional features are worth extra attention ) . yet anastasia may be most intriguing because , unlike disney's features , it feels like a genuine _musical_ , not simply a film with songs attached . when anastasia breaks into song , it's like you're watching an ambitious stage production . it also comes with an unusual but dynamic animation style which combines conventional hand-drawn characters with computer-generated backgrounds . though the juxtapositions don't always work , the effect is stunning when they do . anastasia also serves up a few genuinely creepy images , the kinds you'd associate with ralph bakshi more than with uncle walt . though disney has managed to make a couple of films as satisfying for parents as they were for their children ( beauty and the beast , for certain ) , no recent disney film has felt quite as mature as anastasia . fox , quite predictably , is still marketing anastasia as a family film , and there's not exactly anything which would be considered objectionable . it just seems a shame that anastasia _had_ to become a children's film when this material could have been turned into a spectacular drama unencumbered by cute puppies or talking bats . it's time for someone to take a look at the ratings for television's animation for grown-ups and take a chance . come on , we can handle it . after all , we're not kids any more . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
it's the moment which is supposed to tell the audience that the film-makers are hip to their own derivativeness , that it's pointless to expect more than recycled genre conventions . maybe the skyscraper is now a school , and maybe the vacationing cop is now a surly teen computer whiz , but the rest will be chapter and verse from the contemporary action film bible -- " die hard in a prep school . " right ? well , yes and no . though masterminds has plenty of die hard in its dna -- including a member of the hero's family among the hostages ( ozzie's stepsister melissa , played by katie stuart ) , a suave villain with an accent ( patrick stewart ) and a hidden agenda for the bad guys -- the reference in the script is actually a clever diversion to distract viewers from all the other antecedents . if you've been watching movies at all over the past twenty years , you've seen masterminds before . you just haven't seen it all in the same movie . of course the primary audience for masterminds _hasn't_ been watching movies for the past twenty years ; in fact , it hasn't been alive for the past twenty years . and it's a fairly satisfying diversion for that audience , as well as one their parents don't need to worry aobut . in a sense , it's the way that it's least like die hard which makes masterminds a solid entertainment for youngsters : you don't need to count dead bodies to keep track of the hero's progress . it's unlikely that adults will find much worthwhile in masterminds , unless it's patrick stewart's jolly performance as the leader of the terrorists . he shows a great sense for delivering what the film's audience demands , sneering and threatening just enough so that it's worth a big cheer when he allows himself to be humiliated . he also understands that the plot of masterminds -- which adults will be ahead of by a solid hour -- is about as inventive as your average episode of " scooby-doo ; " you can practically hear stewart begging to end the film with " . . . and i would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for that meddling kid . " by the time it reaches its big finale involving a dune buggy chase through the storm drains beneath the school , masterminds has proven itself to be just playful enough to overcome its obviousness . . . particularly for those too young to remember war games , or die hard , or even home alone . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
starring : stockard channing , will smith , donald sutherland . screenplay : john guare . director : fred schepisi . there are few greater cinematic challenges than adapting a stage play for the screen . the two media are so different -- one primarily of words , the other of images -- that some plays just don't lend themselves to a film rendering . for every amadeus , a play which was opened up into a grand period drams , there is one a few good men , too talky and stagy to succeed fully . that is the problem i fear many viewers could have with six degrees of separation . thematically , john guare's play is quite rich , as it is in character . however , its rapid-fire dialogue and exaggerated acting will strike those unfamiliar with live theater as too stylized and unrealistic . the characters at the heart of six degrees are marvelously intricate , tying together an examination of the vagaries of fortune . where this theme could have come off as a liberal social manifesto , six degrees treads lightly , making the obsession of the kitteredges and their cronies with finding the man who had duped them comic but clear in its message : their world is threatened if just * anyone * can appear to be one of them . the snag in six degrees is that even with its clever editing , even with its location photography , it still feels far too much like a stage play . don't misunderstand , i love live theater . it is just that acting styles and narrative choices which work when a performance is in real time by actual size human beings one hundred feet away don't work when those same human beings are twenty feet high . will smith's genteel paul poitier persona seems too forced and phony for anyone to accept , even the star-struck kitteredges , and the problem is that he's giving a big , broad performance much better suited to the stage . as a result , although i was intrigued with what six degrees had to say , the staginess of the production didn't allow me to get caught up in it . to be fair , not all of the performances have that quality . donald sutherland does an extremely sharp reading of flanders , never permitting him to appear stupid , which it would have been exceedingly easy to do . his sense of outrage grows as his facade crumbles , and he conveys that tension with subtlety and style . six degrees of separation provides some very funny human comedy in an extremely well-constructed story . it's also a story which works much better on stage . 
starring : paolo villaggio , isa danieli , esterina carloni director : lina wertmuller producers : mario and vittorio cecchi gori screenplay : lina wertmuller , leo benvenuti , and piero de bernardi based on me , let's hope i make it by marcello d'orta cinematography : gianni tafani released by miramax films in italian with subtitles " the book [me , let's hope i make it] is a fascinating , allegoric and desperate image of what the children were feeling . telling a story about naples would have been easier to do because in a big city there is a lot of criminality . just when you think all the ore has been removed , however , someone like lina wertmuller comes along and strikes a new vein . is a remarkable film , primarily because it possesses a level of honesty that most productions of this sort abandon in favor of mawkishness . a distinct departure . instead of focusing on issues like sexuality , revenge , and madness , this movie makes do with a simple message of hope . there is no single incident that galvanizes the process . given the time constraints of keeping this film to a reasonable length , wertmuller does a marvellous job fleshing out a unique personality for each of the students . this is not a motion pictures where the children blend together into a faceless mass , with only one or two standouts . through a series of short vignettes , the director tells something about the conditions that have shaped their individual lives . is rich in humor , much of which is grounded in the raw language used by the children . even in the most serious circumstances , wertmuller never allows this motion picture to become maudlin or melodramatic . a relentlessly upbeat , occasionally-playful atmosphere pervades the film , as typified by the repeated use of the song " what a wonderful world . " one of the key ingredients to the success of ciao professore ! is the cast . the adult actors , especially paolo villaggio ( who played one of italy's most enduring film characters , fantozzi , and was in fellini's last film , the voice of the moon ) , do fine jobs . the most remarkable performances , however , come from the troupe of young actors cast to play the children . with their fresh faces and unforced style , each captures the essence of the character wertmuller chose for them . premiered to high acclaim on the international film festival circuit ( where it was called by its original title , me , let's hope i make it ) . the accolades are well-deserved . this is a rare movie- going experience--an artistic film that's both unpretentious and optimistic . 
documentaries work best when they challenge your assumptions and make you think . dutch director johan van der keuken's i ( heart ) $ is a provocative film with an obviously anti-capitalist agenda . the film is mesmerizing because it keeps you on your toes . sandwiched between reasonable arguments are a host of illogical ones and " facts , " which are clearly anything but . made in 1986 and rarely shown in this country , the story is structured as a series of interviews with people , rich and poor . this first segment implants in our subconscious that people make money mainly to manipulate those less fortunate . although it isn't clear , since the film doesn't contain any chapter headings , the next sequence is set in new york city . at first , as we drive by buildings in ruins , we think we are passing through a war zone . this continues the theme of the rich exploiting the poor , and this time it suggests that they do it illegally without ever being caught . the third sequence has an american banker explaining his economic theories . the only benefit of having money that he can think of is to use it to make more money . moreover factory utilization is at an all time low , and people are investing in sexy new technologies rather than basic ones like steel . the banker argues persuasively and is unchallenged by the sympathetic interviewer , but on closer examination , you realize what absolute balderdash it all is , contrast , for example , the stagnation of the 1970s with the boom of the 1980s and 1990s . rather than complaining that the question contains a false assumption , the executive tries to answer it as politely as he can . the exasperating editing and cinematography are the movie's weakest links . long sequences of little value go on long past the time when their points have been made . the camera is sometimes pointed at the strangest places . during one interview we have a long sequences in which all we see is a curtain . we also get lots of close-ups of flowerbeds -- purpose unknown . this visual has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the story . adroitly and seductively presented , the film is fascinating , albeit perhaps not for the reasons the filmmaker intended . i ( heart ) $ runs too long at 2 : 25 . it is not rated but might be pg-13 for brief , partial nudity and would be fine for kids old enough to be interested , which probably means teenagers . 
comedy is hard , which is why most scripts stick to gross-out jokes and easy slapstick . every once and a while a truly gifted filmmaker comes up with just the right formula that takes the genre up a level with the brightness of a script that keeps hitting its comedic mark . road trip's writer/director todd phillips does this with a movie that is at the level of animal house and there's something about mary . the good-spirited laughs come so hard and fast that you'll miss many of the lines as the audience's laughter will drown them out . like these two classics , road trip doesn't pull any punches . a tremendously energetic and fun film , it's a real crowd pleaser that is more than humorous . it's also erotic , smart and wild . needless to say , they'll hit a few speed bumps along the way . this subplot alone is worth the price of admission . puts it , " what am i going to do , stay here and learn ? " these include : " it's not cheating if you're in a different area code . " and " it's not cheating if you're too wasted to remember it , because if you can't remember it , it never really took place . " besides the hilarious dialog , the movie uses physical comedy to maximum effect . there is one sex scene that rivals the zipper and the hair gel incidents in there's something about mary . even the predictable episodes , as when kyle loses his virginity , are staged freshly and sweetly . the movie flies by with such tremendous energy that it's over before you know it . perhaps the highest compliment that i could pay it is to point out that it was one of the few pictures that i've seen in recent memory that i would have loved to have been a half hour longer . i really enjoyed my road trip with these lovable kids , and i think you will , too . it makes you downright nostalgic for a time that never was . the closing credits claimed that the story was fictional , but i'm not buying it . check it out : the director's entire career has been in making documentaries . this one was probably just another . it is rated r for strong sexual content , crude humor , language and drug use and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older . 
director : jan de bont . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 110 minutes . it's too bad there couldn't have been a bit more distance between the release of the blair witch project and the making of the haunting -- then , at least , director jan de bont wouldn't have had an excuse . with recent history to consider , it may have made a perverse economic sense to turn shirley jackson's supremely creepy story into a special effects-filled funhouse . then along comes blair witch to prove that you can still rattle an audience with what might be happening rather than a computer-generated representation of what is happening . ironically , blair witch owes a debt to the original 1963 version of the haunting in its study of the psychology of fear . sadly , the haunting circa 1999 owes a debt to jan ( twister , speed 2 ) de bont in its study of thick-headed filmmaking . an even more bitter irony is that this version of the haunting gathers its characters for a study of the psychology of fear . researcher jeffrey marrow ( liam neeson ) brings together three subjects for an experiment , telling them only that it's a study of insomnia . it's fairly clear from the start that the real star of the haunting is the house itself . de bont sprinkles the film liberally with sweeping helicopter shots of the sprawling exterior ; he prowls through the bending hallways and pans across cavernous great rooms ; he lets cinematographer caleb deschanel bathe the ornate bedrooms in muted oranges and reds . eugenio zanetti's production design is certainly eye-catching , offering more detail than one could possibly absorb in one sitting , but at a certain point the sprawling staginess of the house starts to work against the film . it begins to feel like disney's haunted mansion crossed with the winchester mystery house , a tourist attraction designed more for spooky giggles than for genuine shivers . once the house fails to deliver the creepiness , you're left with the treatment of the material , which is literalist to the mundane extreme . robert wise's 1963 the haunting was hardly perfect -- julie harris' hand-wringing fussiness took her nell too far over the edge from the start -- but it began from the principle that fear is about anticipation , not revelation . de bont has no interest in any such subtleties . instead of making a film about the way an environment of terror is more powerful in imagination than in reality , he makes a film about faces appearing in pillowcases , leaping skeletons , windows that turn into big staring eyeballs , and living statues a la ray harryhausen . with its foundation-shaking finale and monstrous apparitions , this isn't a remake of the haunting . it's a remake of poltergeist . of course there's a place for the poltergeists of cinema . generally , however , it helps if that sort of film can tap into something primal , like scary clowns or menacing trees . the haunting can't really be classified as a horror film , because there's nothing remotely horrifying about it , unless you count the inanely expository dialogue ( e . g . , a character reacting to a stairway collapsing : " look , the stairway is collapsing ! " ) . in fact , it's often downright laughable -- sometimes intentionally ( owen wilson's goofball performance ) , sometimes not ( a blissed-out otherworldly ending that makes ghost look restrained ) . de bont has made a film from the school of quips and money shots , all flash and chuckle . he's merely interested in showing off his big-budget toys so everyone can see the thing that goes ooga-booga . that's a pretty limp take on a tale of the ooga-boogas inside our heads . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
cast : jeremy irons , gong li , maggie cheung , michael hui , ruben blades director : wayne wang producers : lydia dean pilcher , jean-louis piel screenplay : jean-claude carriere and larry gross cinematography : vilko filac music : graeme revell u . s . distributor : trimark pictures in english and chinese with subtitles these are some of the roles essayed by chinese actress gong li , and they have one thing in common ? all of them take place decades or even centuries ago . not until chinese box has any director given gong the role of a modern woman . considering how good she is as vivian , a hong kong nightclub owner , one wonders why it has taken so long . the actress is luminous in jeans and sunglasses , and , although she has trouble forming the unfamiliar english words that comprise much of her dialogue , she proves that she has the screen presence to play a character in any era . sadly , chinese box is not the best forum for a display of her talent . instead of adapting the quirky tone that suffused those films , wang has taken a 180-degree turn into melodrama for this examination of hong kong during the months and days preceding its transition from british to chinese rule . given all of the tension and cultural upheaval generated by the events of july 1 , 1997 , this would seem to be an event capable of inspiring a great motion picture . unfortunately , wang chooses to plunge viewers into a soap opera , a decision which robs chinese box of much of its potential power . this is one of those films where the background elements are far more interesting than those in the foreground . i didn't care much about what happened between john and vivian , primarily because i never felt much for his character . irons is lifeless in this role , and his uninspired performance does little to draw us into john's world . perhaps this individual is supposed to be a living metaphor for the rapidly-diminishing worldwide influence of the once-mighty british empire , but symbols rarely make for interesting protagonists . the most intriguing aspects of the movie are the political and economic implications of the changeover , but those are relegated to the background and shown primarily through cnn news clips . businessmen are nervous , but the only way we know this is through snatches of conversations that wang allows us to overhear . even though gong is wonderful , i wish a lion's share of the time given to the sketchily-developed vivian had been granted to jean . played by the wonderful hong kong actress maggie cheung , who starred in irma vep , jean is lively and energetic ? a welcome contrast to irons . her story , which we learn in bits and pieces , might have made for a better motion picture than the one wang assembled . instead of getting the full narrative , however , we are fed the short version in a series of interludes sandwiched between the cliched development of the tortured romance between john and vivian . however , it's questionable whether any other motion picture will have such a top-notch level of talent in front of and behind the cameras . chinese box is not a terrible film ? it offers a series of semi- satisfying moments for those who crave a sudsy romantic tragedy ? but it is a disappointment . the real puzzle of this chinese box is how so much dramatic potential could result in a film of so little consequence . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
she doesn't love me . but even these words don't make sense , as we find out soon afterwards , that their wife definetly loves one of them more than the other . it ends up looking not quite like a john cassavetes independent film should look . it seems to be written as if someone thought that it would be cute to keep leaving out key parts to the story . as a result , the film suffers from incohesiveness , but because of the caliber of actors involved , they make a cassavetes sandwich seem like it is a cassavetes sandwich , even if there is not much real cassavetes in the sandwich . in other words , the story just wasn't there , it didn't seem to be original , and this from a script by the real mccoy of indie films , is astonishing , to say the least , even the ending of the film feels like a blatant rip off of the graduate . the film , however , managed to be entertaining . it just mostly lacked insight into what these characters were about . nothing was resolved or could be fully understood . for example , it made no sense to think that eddie was well enough to be let free from the institution and still didn't know that he was there for a decade not for three months . too many other things about the movie were either murky or didn't add up , unless you are willing to except anything goes as a satisfactory story line when it comes to dealing with those who are unstable . what worked for me , was the comic reactions by both stanton and travolta , it broke the heavy barrage of emoting from the penns . i also thought that gandolfini did an excellent job in his brief appearance on screen . he held my attention with his mix of manic sadistic moves and cruel humor . without them , this film would have taken itself too serious for the untasty cassavetes sandwich it was trying to serve its too willing captives in the audience . 
starring : richard gere , sharon stone , lolita davidovich . screenplay : david rayfiel & marshall brickman . director : mark rydell . exactly when it happened , i can't put my finger on . for about half an hour of intersection , i was intrigued , and wondered whether i was on to my first guilty pleasure of 1994 . then , at some point , i began to realize that intersection was taking itself far too seriously . while the film is cleverly structured and reasonably well-acted , it began to irritate me that it was trying to turn a mid-life crisis into a great existential drama . worse yet , it presented me with a " hero " i couldn't stand and an ending that left me angry . as i noted , intersection's early scenes boast enough slickness and craft to lend the illusion of consequence . the lead performances by gere , stone and davidovich are all understated , and davidovich in particular generates quite a bit of audience sympathy . efficient editing by mark warner and glossy photography by the talented vilmos zsigmond create a dreamy atmosphere , and james newton howard's jazzy score plays up the romance angle . the dialogue in the script by david rayfiel and marshall brickman is snappy , keeping conversations lively enough to maintain interest . it isn't all that long , however , before it becomes evident that there isn't all that much going on beneath intersection's shiny surface . the performers are " understated " primarily because there is so little substance to any of the characters . olivia is perky and sweet , but it's never particularly clear why she's so into vincent . sally , in the flashback sequences , is made to appear icy and reserved , and one of those scenes is quite clever . still , nothing in her character seems to justify vincent's behavior , and this may be intersection's critical failing . if it seems like i was expecting a morality tale . . . well , by the time it was over , i was . but even those who allow vincent more leeway than i did are likely to be turned off by mark rydell's heavy handed direction . gere's angst ridden face is frequently in close-up , usually while driving ; he probably ends up playing as many scenes with a steering wheel as he does with another actor . an antique clock becomes a distracting symbol , and the omnipresent northwest rain an objective correlative i could have done without . frequent flashbacks and dream sequences make for a dizzying narrative . so many stylistic choices in intersection turned me off that i'm tempted not to mention the off-handed allusion to the fact that vincent's 13-year-old daughter has an eating disorder . eh , why nitpick ? name it and it probably turned me off . 
i think the writers got their facts mixed up about the affects of the poisonous weed , as i believe it acts as an hallucinogenic or as a poison that can kill you , but it doesn't necessarily cause drowsiness and especially not when put into caffeine . the story was trying desperately to say that inter-racial love was okay , and by having the heroic figures of the story be half-breeds , this 1956 film is going as far as it wants to go with that tolerant attitude . it is just too bad that tab is such a vanilla actor and natalie is earnest but unconvincing in her role as a half-breed . their romance has no fire in it , it was almost like it was a pedantic exercise in virtue that we were witnessing . with more suitable actors in the starring roles , this could have been a much more relevant film . the only actor with some life to him was skip homeier , but he was too much of a caricature of evil for his character to be anything but cardboard-like manic . what was out place about this film , was that despite the beautiful photography and gripping action scenes , the story covered no new ground , though it had its opportunities , but it failed to take advantage of them . what remains solid about the film , is that if you get off on watching a western with a revenge motive , then this one never strays from that motive . 
burnt by the sun is a russian film and was the winner of the 1995 academy award for best foreign film . the plot from there made little sense so i will not attempt to outline the story more . if you like russian style humor or if you monty python style british humor , you will probably go gaga over this show . i was at a fairly full movie house where most of the audience set in stone silence as if they didn't get it . a few people however were in non-stop laughter mode . for this show you either love or you hate it . there is no in-between . as you can guess by the rating , i am in the i-don't-get-it category . let me note the two highlights of the show . first , the cinematographer ( vilen kaluta ) manages to make an oppressive dictatorship have a radiant feel that makes you think old joe stalin's country would have been a pretty peaceful place to live . picture perfect . notice how the camera hugs them in the close ups and how the shots are carefully done with a twilight glow . the second highlight of the movie was in the attractive and visually interesting actors cast to play the lead father , mother , and young girl . i found the script by roustam ibraguimbekov and nikita mikhalkov to be a mess . certainly there were the odd , good one liners . mainly though the scriptwriters and the director ( nikita mikhalkov ) relied on broad humor and sight gags of the monty python style . we also had many fat people who were supposed to be funny solely because of their girth . in one scene , a fat woman blocks mitya's view and that in and of itself is supposedly humorous . we have a summer santa figure in a long ugly beard , long hair , and bad clothes , that was supposed to make us laugh . many of the characters had exaggerated gestures in failed attempts at humor . i generally don't like slapstick comedy , and this movie was no exception . i have now seen all of the 1995 academy award for best foreign films . i enjoyed burnt by the sun least of all . although i liked parts of all of the others , eat drink man woman was the only consistently excellent one of the bunch . see my reviews of all of them for more details . it is in russian with english subtitles . it is unrated , but would be pg or perhaps pg-13 for very brief nudity and a little violence . it is a harmless show . i do not recommend it unless you are into sight gags , exaggerated characters , or a fan of russian humor . for the beauty of the filming and for no other reason , i award it * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : june 5 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
producers : robert a . miller , david v . picker . director : nicholas hytner . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . to demonstrate my empathy with the themes of the crucible , i'm going to engage in a bit of heresy of my own : i don't think arthur miller's play is particularly good . i'm not suggesting that it is dated , as other critics have done . the ideas in the crucible were never the issue , but those weighty issues overwhelmed under-developed characters . productions of the crucible have lived or died on the ability of the actors to invest the material with feeling missing from the page , and this first english-language film of the play is no different . fortunately , the cast is very strong , and the conventions of cinema give the energy level a much-needed boost . flawed as it may be , the crucible still has moments of undeniable power . miller's 1953 play is well-known as an allegory for the " red scare " and black-listing of the 1950s , but miller's own screen adaptation attempts to make the story less specific to that era , while also making it more visual . the scenes are not meant simply for shock value , but to emphasize the active hypocrisy of the accusers . winona ryder does some of her best work ever in the role , shedding the restrained quality of her previous period film performances . here she lets loose like an animal -- desperate , haunted and dangerous . ryder is one part of a cast which gives its all to the crucible , beginning with paul scofield as danforth . scofield brings a commanding , weathered presence to the role of salem's grand inquisitor , and a conviction that the judge's work is good and proper . he also gives lines a punch few other actors could muster ; when he announces that he intends to " touch the bottom of this swamp " of accusations and counter-accusations , he utters the word " swamp " with a fearsome authority . joan allen's steady , cool elizabeth is just what the part calls for , and she shows that passive-aggression is not a uniquely 20th century phenomenon . surprisingly , the weak link in the cast is daniel day-lewis . proctor is an under-written role , but there is too much self-righteous heroism in day-lewis's reading . under-written characters and under-developed relationships are the main faults of the crucible as a text ; at times , it feels nearly as plot-driven as a michael crichton novel . the story is meant to provoke the audience to outrage at the lives destroyed by false accusers and complicit authority figures , but it only takes a couple of scenes to make the point rather than the repetitive structure of the children's accusations . still , there are a couple of scenes in the crucible which can get any audience to hold its breath , notably a tense questioning of elizabeth for which there can be no correct answer . director nicholas hytner ( the madness of king george ) offers an interpretation which isn't in the least iconoclastic , but he knows where to use george fenton's score or a lingering close-up to give a scene added weight . the crucible is a good ( though not great ) adaptation of a good ( though not great ) play which still has the ability to cast its own spell . 
screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala . director : james ivory . if ismail merchant and james ivory are not careful , their names might very well lose their proper noun status . like q-tip or xerox , " merchant ivory " is becoming something of a generic term , a descriptor for intimate period pieces in the tradition of critical successes like a room with a view , howards end and the remains of the day . for many moviegoers , though , the term is also used to evoke images of technically proficient but turgid filmmaking . sadly , jefferson in paris is everything their most vocal detractors have accused merchant ivory efforts of being . there are plenty of beautiful sets , meaningful glances and profound discussions , but there isn't a shred of compelling drama to connect them , or a single key character into whose life we are given any insight . this is not a biographical sketch with a point of view . it's a series of anecdotes , many of them apocryphal . or a lengthy scene at an opera in which the relationship between jefferson and maria cosway is not furthered one bit ? writer ruth prawer jhabvala is a genius at adapting the narratives of other writers for the screen , but she does a terrible job of constructing a narrative from a collection of historical footnotes . this is simply everything you always wanted to know about thomas jefferson but were afraid to ask . it is an awful performance of a character with tremendous potential , and the script never even bothers to try to get inside his head . i felt i had a better understanding of jefferson from staring at mount rushmore . ivory does deliver some finely crafted scenes , of course , such as louis xvi learning about the revolution while on a hunt , and richard robbins' score and tony pierce-roberts' cinematography are characteristically superb . it isn't about the scandalous , if historically questionable , notion that jefferson fathered children by one of his slaves . it isn't really * about * anything . like the worst high school history textbooks , it just starts in one place and ends in another , and all you really want to do is look at the pictures . 
keeping the faith is not a feature length version of the old joke about a priest and a rabbi walking into a bar . . . not exactly , anyway . the set-up finds director/co-star edward norton exploiting exactly that concept as his character -- new york catholic priest brian finn -- relates the film's story to an incredulous barkeep . there's a lot of ground to be covered in a romantic comedy that also introduces questions of faith , cultural and religious melting pots and balancing career and personal goals . and keeping the faith seems intent on covering every last square foot of it . screenwriter stuart blumberg dashes madly back and forth between themes , while norton dashes madly back and forth between tones ( how else to describe a sentimental romance that also includes slapstick dips in holy water fonts and the surreal inclusion of " heroes of the torah " trading cards ? ) . oh , and somewhere along the way they're supposed to fit in a love story . it's no wonder norton felt the need to have a lightweight film clock in at two hours plus . thank heaven that keeping the faith is often quite funny in its fragmented , scattershot way . blumberg's script is ripe with good dialogue , and a couple of solidly crafted set pieces ( including a jewish american princess date from hell ) . stiller continues to build a body of comic screen work that measures up to any of his contemporaries , giving zing to jake's self-deprecating manner . there are eye-catching bit parts , including ken leung in a very funny scene as a karaoke machine salesman . and there's jenna elfman , who has never particularly impressed me in the past except as a ball of energy . here she's a completely convincing object of desire ( even if norton lingers on her close-ups a bit too lovingly ) , luminous , intelligent and driven . as one part of a romantic pairing , she's a tough act to match . the match , as it turns out , becomes one of keeping the faith's bigger problems . the premise is sound enough , but stiller never looks comfortable as a romantic lead . in fact , there's more plausible chemistry between elfman and norton , and not just because both actors are blonde -- the pairing we're expected to root for just doesn't seem like a particularly good combination of personalities . how much more interesting -- and daring -- keeping the faith might have been if the film had suggested anna was merely sublimating her desire for brian with jake , making for much tougher choices at the film's conclusion . that's probably too much to ask from a film that , at its core , is a fairly fluffy hollywood confection . it's certainly a pleasant enough diversion , good for more than enough chuckles to make it worth a look , but it's surprisingly timid for a film that tries to cover so many thematic elements . it's also a lot warmer 'n' fuzzier than you'd expect from the cinematic equivalent of " a priest and a rabbi walk into a bar . . .

one of those innovative shoestring budget sci-fier films that edgar g . ulmer made a career out of . this one is overall a competent work with some uniquely atmospheric scenes . it used the same set designs as ingrid bergman did in the 1948 " joan of arc . " the alien invaders didn't put up much of a fight , but i bet if ulmer had a few more days of shooting time we would have seen a lot more action . 
cast : jack nicholson , david morse , angelica huston , robin wright , priscilla barnes director : sean penn producers : david s . hamburger and sean penn screenplay : sean penn cinematography : vilmos szigmond music : jack nitzche u . s . distributor : miramax films when something like that happens because of a drunk driver , it raises a specter of impotent fury that no dose of reason can ever dispel . the problem with the crossing guard is not the premise or core theme , but the manner in which director sean penn breathes life into the story . this film is horribly unfocused . significant chunks of screen time are devoted to unrelated , superfluous , and cryptic sequences . many apparently have been included for the purpose of enhanced characterization , but , since basic character development is handled effectively early in the movie , much of this material is redundant . how many times do we have to be reminded that freddy is on the edge ? as john , morse gives a powerful , contained performance that is all the more effective because it is so controlled . despite what he did , we feel for him . much of nicholson's portrayal involves over-the-top ranting ( the actor's usual shtick ) , which becomes tiresome . fortunately , there are scenes where he is restrained , and there's a palpable tension to those moments . when penn hits the right tone , his direction shows undeniable power . the crossing guard contains several noteworthy scenes . then there's john's description of what it was like to watch emily die . had all of the crossing guard been put together with such deft skill , this could have been an amazing motion picture . alas , what's on-screen too often devolves into ineffective melodrama . in any such point-by-point study , however , sean penn's film , with its spotty treatment of powerful emotional topics , does not fare favorably . on balance , the crossing guard probably succeeds more often than not , but there are enough serious missteps to raise doubts about whether this film is worth a trip to a theater . 
the question is whether it was a meaninglessly brief three-second encounter or a more significant full five . a host of studios stand at the ready to deliver the r-rated slasher flicks and the crude sexual humor movies that teenagers flock to in droves . there aren't many studios , however , who still attempt to make a buck off of innocent , pg-rated fare featuring teens . disney is one of the few , and , even if they sometimes come up with harmless duds like i'll be home for christmas , they should be commended for trying . the jokes in the movie are so silly that some of the laughs become almost embarrassing . the most awkward aspect of the movie is the dialog . written at a junior high school level , the setting at a college campus seems inappropriate . the kid locked in his locker routine , for example , isn't something that usually occurs in a college movie . the setup for the road picture is that jake's dad has made a deal with him . the casting of jessica biel as allie is a nice and unexpected touch . she seems much more likely to hang out at the library than the mall . this is a small movie that will probably be long gone way before christmas . one supposes that the marketing department was worried about the crush of all of the movies opening at christmas . even if it is generally lame , the movie is not without its charms . in one nice visual , there is a 5k race open only to people in full santa claus regalia . lose your hat or beard , and you're disqualified . it is rated pg for a few , quite mild profanities and would be fine for the whole family . my son jeffrey , age 9 , thought the film was " really good " and gave it * * * ? . 
some interesting race-related points are raised , but van peebles disappoints by focusing instead on the standard elements of the picture . by the film's end , this has degenerated into little more than a 19th-century shoot-em-up . posse is a violent movie , but without the grittiness that characterized clint eastwood's academy award winning unforgiven . technically , this film is a mess . however , in posse , the editing is sub-par--scenes often come to jarring conclusions . the music at times seems better-suited to a contemporary action film than a western , and the quick changing of camera angles occasionally makes posse feel like something created for mtv . despite numerous problems , posse remains an entertaining film . in addition to bringing a refreshingly new perspective to the western , it tells a solid story . the subplot involving graham perhaps creates some unnecessary baggage , but the main conflict between van peebles and richard jordan in freemanville is well-developed . a comparison to glory is worth making . in many ways , the intentions of the two films are similar--both attempt to redress the historical inaccuracies of hollywood . however , where glory succeeds brilliantly by wedding the dramatic impact of the black man's role in the civil war with its overall tale , posse fails to attain the same level . with only a few minor script alterations and some re-casting , this could easily have been an all-white film . many of the most important and intriguing questions about the real roles of blacks in the old west are sadly left unexplored . posse serves merely to whet our appetites . even considering the limited success of the attempt , it's important that the effort was made , if for no other reason than that to open a few eyes and make some people aware of the bias of a white-written american history . posse also has enough entertainment value to make it worth a look , especially for those who enjoy westerns . it certainly isn't a definitive film , but it has its high points . 
it plays out as a horror comedy low-budget b-film that is a parody of the hip art world and those who seek fame . its satire cuts deeper into this bohemian world than most other films . walter is discovered by leonard as a murderer , but since collectors are willing to pay big bucks for such detailed realistic work--he doesn't tell the cops . charles b . griffith provides the film with a witty script . character actor dick miller gives an impressionable performance , as does his romantic interest barboura morris . it's a bloody black comedy that is gruesomely funny and because of its unsophisticated way of probing into the underground art world--it exudes a radiant charm , a true cult film delight from the 1950s made for all eras . 
it stars albert finney in another of his wonderful performances . he makes you feel his character's joy and his pain . unlike his excellent role last year in the browning version , this time we find him as basically a happy and joyful character albeit one with an underlying sadness whereas in the other show he played a sad person who repressed any feeling of contentment . the bus in this movie is like none you have ever seen before . it is almost reminiscent of the magic school bus kid's tv show on pbs . they have great fun doing this--most especially finney . watch how much fun he is having . it may make you want to spring into a character in the next dull meeting you are at and start quoting lines from oscar wilde . the plot is predictable , but who cares . you really have fun watching all of the regulars on the bus and soon you begin to feel you are one of them . there is a key part of the rest of the movie that all of the reviews i have seen have talked about , but i will not give it away . you will be able to guess it early on probably . suffice it to say , that i think finney is quite convincing with all parts of the role . the grays and the steel blues of dublin in the early 60s are a bit melancholy but beautiful . as one who loves old buses , this show was a special treat . the colors in the cinematography were well chosen and quite evocative of the mood of the piece . this is not a mega movie . it is more like a little tone poem . for what it is , it is well done . although it is bittersweet , it is a feel good movie . i left the theater singing the happy song from the credits and feeling elated as if i now somehow was one of the regulars and had some part in soleme . the movie is carefully edited and runs 1 : 38 . it is rated r for a little nudity , a little violence and adult themes . older teenagers could see it with no problems . i recommend this show to you and give it * * 1/2 . although it is not popular with most critics ( lots of " who cares " and mild thumbs down ) , i was happy to find that one major critic ( peter stack of the sf chronicle ) did like it and even more than me in that he gave it his top rating . i think the movie is good , but it is not that good . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are solely mine & not meant to reflect my employer's . 
it was suddenly possible to see humans and dinosaurs interacting in a way that had never before been possible , and to feel the entire theater shake with the approach of a tyrannosaurus rex . effects houses like industrial lights and magic have tackled bigger , more imposing objects such as tornadoes and volcanoes , but it's still basically the same technology that jurassic park ushered in . and , because the lost world doesn't offer anything especially innovative , it seems rather familiar and almost ( but not quite ) disappointing . like its predecessor , the lost world is basically a big-budget monster movie of the sort that has been popular ever since the dawn of motion pictures . unfortunately , like many entries into the genre , it falls into expected patterns . as a result , much of this movie seems like a retread of jurassic park ( with a little king kong thrown in at the end ) , not because director steven spielberg is intentionally copying himself , but because there's really not much more that he can do with the premise . if there's a third movie in the series , it will probably follow pretty much the same storyline as the first and second installments . still , repetitiveness notwithstanding , the lost world boasts several edge-of-the-seat moments . the standout sequence in this film features two t- rexs , a lot of rain , spiderweb fissures in glass , and a literal cliffhanger . next year's godzilla will hopefully do a more impressive job with the " dinosaur loose in a city " concept . returning from the first film is jeff goldblum as dr . ian malcolm , a mathematician with an analytical mind and a wry sense of humor . the differences between jurassic park and the lost world can be summed up relatively simply : more dinosaurs , fewer legitimate thrills . in this case , familiarity doesn't breed contempt , but it results in a movie that's unlikely to keep viewers going back time-after-time the way they did for the original . the lost world is solid entertainment the first time ; it's not something i have any great desire to sit through again . if so , it really doesn't work . the self-deprecating scientist is likable exclusively because of jeff goldblum ; even after two films , he's still relatively one-dimensional . meanwhile , arliss howard represents the obligatory nasty corporate villain type . perhaps the most disappointing thing about the lost world is how perfunctory and unimaginative steven spielberg's direction often is . in his more than two decades of film making , spielberg has been responsible for a variety of innovative action/adventure movies -- jaws , raiders of the lost ark , and jurassic park , to name a few . the magical spark that characterizes so many spielberg films is largely absent . it is to this year what independence day was to last year -- the summer's single " can't miss " motion picture ( or so the advertisers would have us believe ) . it also comes early enough in the season so that we're not already sick to death of this kind of effects-oriented action/adventure . so , although the lost world has its share of problems , chief of which is the familiarity factor , it still offers a couple hours of glitzy , hi-tech fun . and that's just about all that anyone can reasonably expect from this kind of blockbuster . 
an atmospheric , thrilling whodunit , that is full of surprises , is fast-paced , and is well-acted . but the case puzzles him as all the clues so easily point to brent , it's as if the ex-con has been framed . 
too bad the actors , in this imitation of a bad sitcom pilot , couldn't get their names removed from the credits . the dogs , who only drool and smile , deliver more lively and interesting performances . they are all vapid . in the few , the very few , times the movie approaches even mildly cute , the director kills the moment , almost as if he were trying to keep the movie from being funny . although marketed as a romantic comedy , in truth the movie belongs to a genre that might be called laughless non-romances . the studio did not screen the film in advance to critics in the hope , one suspects , that some people would see it before the word got out as to how bad it was . as in a daytime soap opera , the characters are captured in periodic shifts of their musical beds . in fact , you could probably write a better script from this premise than mcculloch did . " what you need is country and western music . " " what do you do ? " " i work writing classifieds , " he replies with his signature earnestness , as if his every answer had some hidden sad portent . " i've read your work -- some of it's pretty good , " she says . the scene , which is one of those with a modicum of promise , is killed by the dull tone that the director sets . when the two lovebirds , andy and lorna , go home to kiss , they look like a couple of adults trying to make fish mouths to entertain small children . surely these actors have kissed someone before . if not , they should have practiced in advance . maybe the movie's material was hopeless from the outset . i have spared the rest of the large cast from embarrassment by not mentioning their names . a sleep-inducing film , dog park simply has nothing to recommend it . it should have gone direct to video so that the lower price would make viewers feel slightly less cheated . it is rated r for sexuality and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
this is an unsentimental and marvelously acted family drama , set in a backwater dumpy australian seacoast town . the script by laura jones is intelligent and pertinent , the woman director gillian armstrong ( my brilliant career ) has made a nearly flawless film , and the three lead actresses draw out their complicated characters in ways that touch the heart with the mark of unbridled reality . the film doesn't flinch and tells the story without leaving a way out for any of the parties involved . it shows that a mother doesn't have to be perfect , she can have flaws as almost all do , but there's something about a child being raised by her real mother that means so much to both . there are no easy answers given here , what the film does best is concentrate on how this accidental meeting has a devastating effect on all three lives and it does it in a fresh way . judy davis is one of the best actresses around today , and her performance is powerful . this is just a brilliant film , my only quibble with it is a minor one . 
screenplay : andrew stanton and donald mcenery & bob shaw . producers : darla k . anderson and kevin reher . directors : john lasseter and andrew stanton . mpaa rating : g . running time : 95 minutes . a bug's life deserves better . it deserves better than to be held up to that other computer-animated insect film from earlier this fall . it deserves better than to be compared to that other feature from pixar . it's virtually impossible to talk about a bug's life without invoking antz and/or toy story , but it deserves better . films with this much wit , energy and imagination are too uncommon to diminish this one with such petty comparisons . a bug's life is not just a delightful computer-animated family film about insects . it's a delightful film . not that it's a perfect one . the botched circus sequence in which they are introduced recalls warner bros . cartoons at their most rapid-fire anarchic , with the cast of colorful performers all delivering laughs . though foley is a pleasant enough presence , his redemption storyline isn't nearly as interesting as the circus performers' search for an adoring audience . he serves much the same function here as he does on tv's " newsradio , " acting as the sane center around which more charismatic characters can do their thing . he's also the center around which the animators can do their thing , and they do more than enough things to make for a wonderful ride . the throwaway gags in flik's visit to the " big city " -- an annoying street mime mimicking flik's every move , a cricket panhandler with a sign announcing " wings pulled off by kids " -- are consistently appealing to viewers of all ages . director john lasseter has an uncanny eye for setting up a scene , and a comic sensibility most directors of live action should be willing to kill for . nowhere is that more evident than during the closing credits , when lasseter pulls out the kind of brilliant conceit that makes really good films feel like great films . miss the final five minutes at your own peril . sure , it would have been nice if a bug's life had had a story as tightly constructed as the buddy bonding of woody and buzz in toy story . it would have been nice if the lead character had had as distinctive a personality as woody allen's z in antz . those are the nit-picking details you have to come up with when a film offers as much pure fun as a bug's life . silly enough for kids , smart enough for adults , grandly-staged enough for anyone who loves movies , it offers entertainment that deserves a different kind of comparison . understand that there probably haven't been a half-dozen better films of _any_ kind this year , and you'll be on to the kind of comparison a bug's life really deserves . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
their latest film called james and the giant peach features their claymation , as known as stop-action , images that are their trademark . this time their vision is exuberant and only infrequently morose . the grasshopper ( voice by simon callow ) is an intellectual , the ladybug ( voice by glynis johns ) is a sweet older lady , the spider ( voice by susan sarandon ) is reserved and misunderstood , the earthworm ( voice by david thewlis ) feels like he is always being used , and the best one of all , the centipede ( voice by richard dreyfuss ) , is laugh central . as the jocular main part of the film picks up , the cinematography ( pete kozachik ) makes an abrupt transition and the colors switch to rich and lush oranges and blues . the show is more than just fantastical sights like the giant mechanical shark that attacks them . it also has a plot and a clever boy to guide it . what would you do if a shark attached your giant peach ? bet you didn't think of that one ! his secret is that , " when i have a problem , my mom and dad taught me to look at it another way . " amazing . a show where parents are the good guys and even have advice worth pondering and even remembering . the script is not only clever but funny . the show is full of musical numbers ( randy newman ) , and this is the weakest part of the film . they are not especially good , and paul terry's voice is wonderful as james , but too weak and harsh for singing . the musical numbers are quite slow and may bore some of the more antsy kids in the audience . this movie may not make headlines among all of the adults , but i predict it will among the kids . i got a new front page . it is rated pg for some potentially scary images of charging rhinos and creepy skeletons . i was in a large audience and none of the kids seemed the least bit scared ; nevertheless , it could frighten kids under 5 . like the much better toy story , this film is highly imaginative and willing to take lots of risks . it should inspire creativity and joy in kids of all ages so i recommend it to everyone and award it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
as good as it gets is a perfect christmas release , not because the story takes place during the yule season , but because many of the plot elements are straight out of charles dickens' a christmas carol . there's more than just a little scrooge in melvin udall ( jack nicholson ) , the most unpleasant man in manhattan . by the time we leave the theater , the warmth of love has melted the coldest heart on earth . that's the reason this is called a " feel good " movie . as good as it gets is really two related movies in one , which explains the surprisingly long running time . while 138 minutes is fine for an epic adventure or a weighty drama , it makes a lightweight effort like this seem a little bloated . director james l . brooks , who does these kinds of movies as well as anyone in hollywood , has moderate success . as good as it gets is not a positive triumph , but it does bring a smile to the face and , perhaps in some cases , a tear to the eye . to make matters worse , melvin is afflicted with an obsessive/compulsive disorder that makes his behavior seem even more strange . of course , no one can change overnight , and there are times when the old melvin rears his ugly head , leading to plot complications . nicholson is wonderful as melvin the jerk . he delivers the acid one-liners with real venom , has perfected the irritating mannerisms of an obsessive/compulsive individual , and generally makes it easy to accept the character as the last person you'd want to spend any time with . he does have some great lines , though . like melvin , the events in as good as it gets transform carol , but her gentler , gradual personality shift is more believable . alas , she and nicholson never really click , which puts something of a damper on the romantic storyline . the real surprise is greg kinnear , who turns in a more solidly dramatic performance than we had a right to suspect based on his past record . in sabrina , kinnear displayed a feckless charm , but here he's required to dig deeper . ultimately , it's the quirks and details of as good as it gets' script ( by brooks and co-writer mark andrus ) , rather than the broad strokes , which make the film enjoyable . essentially , this is a formulaic , connect-the-dots tale which offers few , if any surprises . fifteen minutes into the movie , you'll be able to guess exactly how it will all work out . as a result , the chief pleasure for the next two hours is watching the characters grow and interact as they traverse the familiar path . as good as it gets may not quite live up to its title , but it doesn't fall unacceptably short of the mark . - ingmar bergman 
richard pearce's a family thing is a pleasant , if not especially groundbreaking , motion picture that takes the " buddy movie " concept a step forward by introducing themes of race relations and kinship . the film has more to say than might be initially obvious from the seemingly- straightforward script , which was written by one false move scribes billy bob thornton and tom epperson . all the topics presented on an intimate level are equally applicable to society as a whole , which has become more sensitive to issues of skin color than those of basic humanity . if you thought arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito made strange brothers , how about robert duvall and james earl jones ? as a family thing chronicles one man's gradual acceptance of himself , it reminds us that skin color is an artificial , not a natural , barrier . so what if earl's skin is lighter than ray's -- that doesn't change their shared parentage . the usual " mismatched buddy " film conventions are present : initial resentment and dislike that leads to a physical confrontation , followed by bonding and grudging admiration that grows into genuine affection . with actors of duvall and jones' caliber , however , such formulas attain a higher-than-ordinary level . despite its good intentions , a family thing could easily have been a mediocre drama , but the excellent performances elevate the film considerably . several scenes are over-the-top , and the character of ray's son , virgil ( michael beach ) , is woefully underdeveloped ( the result of editing choices ) , but , overall , this film is an agreeable exploration of what it means to be part of a family . much like the birdcage , although without that film's comic excesses , a family thing isn't just about accepting one's circumstances , but embracing them . the actors , playing characters it's easy to sympathize with , bring the story alive . because duvall and jones establish a successful rapport , a family thing has an unexpectedly strong emotional resonance , and that's a key reason why viewers are likely to leave this movie satisfied . 
sgt . bilko is a highly forgettable , but quite funny remake of the classic phil silvers tv show from the mid 50s known variously as " the phil silvers show " , " you'll never get rich " , and simply " sergeant bilko . " i was a nine year old when the series started and was a fan of it . only steve martin and possibly robin williams have the comedic strength to revive the show . here it is steve martin playing the role that is both a homage to phil silvers and yet is a fresh rendition as well . in short , this is not martin at his best and the movie has a lot of gags , especially sight gags , that don't work , but the movie does has a lot of belly laughs in it . a sure fire audience pleaser even if not exactly blockbuster material . i think this movie has some of the worst trailers for it that i have seen in quite a while , but i saw them so often that this slapstick comedy began to grow on me a bit before i ever walked into the theater . the movie has exactly three things going for it and no more . the acting by martin , that of straight man dan aykroyd playing sgt . the rest of the acting is fairly pedestrian but phil hartman as major thorn as well as his two accountant sidekicks are awful . most of the technical aspects of the show like the cinematography , music , and sets are acceptable , but nothing special . his philosophy about gambling is , " i like a sporting event in which i know the outcome ahead of time . it's more organized . " he does not run a very tight ship . it's 10am . in the funniest part of the show , sgt . the outcome is hilarious . bilko , and the plot of most of the show is that major thorn tries to prove a case against bilko . bilko is a conniver , but also a whiner . everything that martin does is cute right down to the way he carries himself and his funny little quasi-mocking salute . sgt . bilko runs a quick 1 : 32 thanks to fast paced editing by tony lombardo . i was amazed to find the show was a correctly rated pg one . i expected something much raunchier . there is no sex , nudity , or violence . if they said any bad words , i can not remember them . sgt . bilko is not great art , but i laughed a lot as did the rest of the audience , and i think you will too so i recommend the film and give the picture * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
starring : kristin scott-thomas , claudiu bleont , marcel iures director : lucian pintilie producer : lucian pintilie screenplay : lucian pintilie cinematography : calin ghibu music : anton suteu released by mk2 productions in romanian , french , and english with subtitles an unforgettable summer doesn't have the same stylish photography or non-chronological narrative , and it takes place in 1925 rather than in the present-day , but both films address the tragic results when intolerance ( tribal or racial ) and political expediency take precedence over simple , human compassion . the story underlying an unforgettable summer is simple and stark . not so straightforward are the questions of conscience posed by lucian pintilie's script . the basic impotence of the characters only emphasizes the real-world difficulties faced by peacemakers . it's seductively easy to kill a bunch of scapegoats and conveniently sweep any dissidents under the nearest rug . despite a fine performance by british actress kristin scott-thomas ( best known for the role of fiona in four weddings and a funeral , and displaying trilingual abilities here ) , her character doesn't have much real depth , and that's one of an unforgettable summer's glaring weaknesses . in fact , as tenuous as the audience's connection is to marie-therese , it's even less certain where petre is concerned . at times , the captain is too cold and distant to court favor from any viewer . an unforgettable summer is getting very limited distribution , but for those who have an opportunity to see it , the movie makes an excellent companion piece to before the rain . 
australia , 1994 u . s . availability : widely variable ( 1995 ) running length : 1 : 52 mpaa classification : no mpaa rating ( profanity , mature themes ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 how does the world view australia ? hotel sorrento , a thoughtful and nicely acted ( if occasionally pedantic ) motion picture , attempts to answer this question , among others . but the real meat of the story is the examination of the dynamics of yet another dysfunctional family -- the ties that bind them and the buried secrets that rip them apart . although the three interact civilly , and occasionally show signs of compassion and even affection , it's clear that something is rotten at the core of the three-pronged relationship . though occasionally melodramatic , the unfolding of family secrets and the revelation of how they have poisoned the sisters' relationship gives hotel sorrento its momentum . of less interest are the political dissertations about how australia has modernized during the past ten years , shedding its love of the static and embracing a willingness to change . some of the dialogue , which aspires to the level of that of french writer/director eric rohmer , ends up more pretentious than insightful , and several of the conversations go on for longer than they probably should . nevertheless , despite missteps , it's the dialogue , with all of its philosophical musings and politically-charged wrangling , that differentiates hotel sorrento from the more common family dramas . the problem is that some of the time devoted to abstract arguments might have been focused on more fully fleshing out the emotional elements . by the end of the picture , there are still several noticeable holes that need plugging . director richard franklin succeeds in tying together politics and the moynihan family , but never completely explores each sister's pain to the extent where this dimension of the relationship contributes effectively to the film's overall impact . hotel sorrento is a pleasant , atmospheric film seeking to paint a comprehensive socio- political portrait that it never quite gets on the canvas . 
chopper , written and directed by andrew dominik , is based on the books written by one of australia's most notorious criminals , mark " chopper " read , but the film is careful to point out that the story is not a biography , per se . what it is is a chilling tale that is made even more intriguing by being based on a real criminal . the compelling reason to see chopper is the tour de force performance by eric bana as chopper . ( a reason not to see it , for some , is that it is intense , realistic and graphically violent . ) bana so inhabits his part as chopper that it becomes hard to belief that he is just acting . bana is probably a sweet guy in real life , but , after seeing this movie , you'd probably run away if you met him in public . chopper , looking like a hell's angel with an almost indecipherable aussie accent , has rolls of fat on his beer belly . his skin is tattooed , not with works of body " art " but rather with something that looks more like doodling , and his mouth is filled with shiny metal teeth . between violent episodes in and out of prison , there are some humorous scenes as well . chopper is the kind of guy to whom there are no right answers . although most viewers are probably uncomfortable with such intense experiences as chopper , for those who can stomach it , this movie is a fascinating portrait of a frightening man . and it contains a great performance by eric bana . it is not rated but would be nc-17 for graphic violence , drug usage and language and would be acceptable for college students and older . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
starring : rip torn , tantoo cardinal , bill raymond , michael j . fox , mark margolis , treat williams director : jay craven producers : jay craven and bess o'brien screenplay : jay craven and don bredes based on the novel by howard frank mosher music : the horseflies released by caledonia pictures one hardly expects a movie about logging to be this compelling . the reason is that co-writer/director jay craven has the good sense to keep the actual mechanics of logging in the background while bringing the characters to the fore . and no matter how much rip torn's noel lord may be shaped by his craft ( " i'm a logger . no matter how much we hate to admit it , this has always been the way of this country , and jay craven's feature debut is just another example . quinn and clayton are stereotypes , and no attempt is made to characterize them as more than one-dimensional villains . they want the land , and that's all there is to it . the reality of their interactions easily shunts aside the shallowness with which the script treats the power company executives . veteran actor rip torn , who played similar parts in heartland and cross creek , gives a gritty , gutsy performance as the long-haired , cigarette-smoking noel . one doesn't often talk about " chemistry " with older characters , but it's definitely there . in addition to being beautifully photographed and establishing a strong sense of " place " , craven's film is thoughtful , well-paced , and never manipulative . the latter is critical , because it keeps certain scenes from descending into melodrama . ultimately , this period piece gives us a glimpse into a part of history that many may not be familiar with . even more importantly , it presents an opportunity to spend one- hundred odd minutes with a pair of characters the likes of which we rarely come across - in person or on screen . 
a complex contemporary horror flick based on a novel by whitley strieber , that is slow in developing and when it becomes evident what's happening there's more interest intellectually in what is uncovered than thrills . there's much self-indulgent ecology to chew on , in this slickly filmed surrealistic presentation . but i found the film to be on the dull side ( except for the camera work ) . outstanding british cinematographer gerry fisher does the honors of making this a very stylish looking film , which gives the impression that something deeper than what appears to be happening is taking place . all the camera shots are presented in this manner , showing how the wolves can pick up man's scent much quicker than he can theirs and their heat-seeking vision can detect their quarry's body temperature . they cannot be vanquished ; so i guess the message is , that we better learn how to live with the werewolf , they will always be with us . hey , i'm willing to give it shot . . . as i think finney is , also . 
its saving grace is that it is well presented . it is narrated in a serious tone by reed hadley . 
screenplay : robert b . weide , based on the novel by kurt vonnegut . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 113 minutes . having read most of kurt vonnegut's novels before viewing mother night , i predicted to myself that it was the most likely of vonnegut's works to make a successful transition to the screen . much of the vonnegut canon has struck me as singularly unfilmable -- including one which _was_ filmed , slaughterhouse-five -- but mother night's narrative was a relatively straightforward one , and its themes equally direct . in a sense , director keith gordon's mother night has proved me correct ; in another sense , it has proved me dreadfully wrong . thought well-crafted and moderately compelling in its own right , mother night loses a lot with the absence of vonnegut's ironic voice . where the novel was a sly social comedy , the film strives almost for greek tragedy . it is a finely constructed narrative which holds the focus on one of vonnegut's key lines : " we are what we pretend to be , so we must be careful what we pretend to be . " there is a difference , however , between retaining lines and retaining the tone of those lines , and that is where robert b . weide's script becomes a disappointment . though mother night deals with heavy subject matter -- conscience , personal identity , the holocaust -- vonnegut never resorted to heaviness to tell the story . the kind of detached irony which is vonnegut's stock in trade is tough to convey cinematically , and gordon steers instead into the twin extremes of overly straight drama ( as in the scene where campbell watches an old newsreel of himself with growing horror ) or broad comedy ( the portrayal of a collection of hate-mongers who idolize campbell ) . too often , however , the earnestness becomes burdensome . it is an example of gordon and weide's traditional filmic story-telling that they try to turn certain twists of identity or plot developments into grand surprises , when vonnegut reveals them casually through campbell's narration long before the events occur chronologically . mother night may be one of his most traditionally plotted novels , but it still isn't about the plot . . . it's about a perspective and an idea . gordon has not made a bad film ; it is well-acted and keeps you interested from moment to moment . he simply wants campbell's moment of truth to come like a thunderbolt , rather than the way vonnegut prefers to deliver it : as a single finger tapping you ever so lightly on the shoulder . 
screenplay : bob brunner and garry marshall . director : garry marshall . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual content , adult themes , mild profanity ) running time : 127 minutes . i never bought dustin hoffman as an autistic savant in rain man . tom hanks as slow-witted forrest gump was all vocal mannerisms . kevin bacon in the soon-to-video digging to china seemed to be mimicking pee-wee herman . movie stars trying to play mentally handicapped characters do so for any number of reasons -- the parts are juicy , the challenge is unique , and ( if two of the three above examples are any indication ) the chance for an oscar is pretty good . clearly plenty of viewers ( and other critics ) eat up such portrayals with a spoon . i generally spend two hours watching a movie star failing miserably at suspending my disbelief . the other sister is a ghastly exercise for any number of reasons , but the primary reason is juliette lewis . leave it to director garry marshall to make a tv-movie look like a paradigm of subtlety and sensitivity . the story leaps from episode to episode in search of a consistent tone , dragging its fine cast through the muck along the way . they're the worst kind of hollywood character constructions , sit-com versions of mary tyler moore and donald sutherland in ordinary people . and the wacky premise for that sit-com just isn't funny . i'm sure that everyone involved in the other sister felt they were making a heart-warming tale of triumph over adversity , which it very well might have been if there seemed to be a shred of authenticity to the situations . lewis is a large part of the problem , and not necessarily because she does such a terrible job . it's somehow easier to buy ribisi , though his performance certainly isn't light-years beyond lewis's . juliette lewis , however , is always juliette lewis , from the first minute she's on screen until the last , an actress trying to convince me she's a mentally handicapped person . watching lewis screw up her face and twist her dialogue becomes like watching a white actor playing a character in blackface -- not just a case of miscasting , but wrong on a gut level . that reaction isn't mitigated by a script which , frankly , draws nearly every one of its laughs from the goofy behavior of its handicapped characters . viewers may kid themselves into thinking they're laughing good-naturedly at the struggles of these characters to be more like " normal people , " but every gag is really at their expense . the other sister is a sideshow masquerading as a feel-good tale -- see the handicapped kids trying to figure out sex ! see them get drunk and say inappropriate things ! indeed , the other sister stands as a shining example of all that can go wrong in a film about mentally handicapped people . in the rare examples that have worked -- leonardo dicaprio in what's eating gilbert grape , tom hulce in dominick and eugene -- you felt someone was telling a real story of which handicapped characters happened to be a part . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
alaska is about as basic as film-making gets , and that is not entirely a criticism . disney used to make a series of films called " true life adventures , " wilderness yarns chock full of great scenery , cute critters and just enough darwinian conflict not to be alarming to the little ones in the audience . those films were basic -- a vista , an animal , a fight , repeat -- but most of the time they were also effective . that is the vibe alaska is looking for , and might actually have matched if it hadn't had so many darned humans . there is some lively adventure in alaska , but when most of the real fun comes on four legs , it is difficult not to lose patience with the two-legged cast members . i won't waste too much time on the trite and silly elements of alaska , because fortunately scripters andy burg and scott myers do us the same favor . it even has the best bad actor in screen history as its villain ( who , coincidentally enough , happens to be the director's father ) . and yes , it does perplex me how sean made it through three days of rock climbing , wading in icy rivers and plodding through the frozen tundra in his adidas high-tops . no , the problem with alaska isn't that the people are one-dimensional characters or mediocre actors . even after coke has turned computer-generated frolicking polar bears into a corporate logo , the real thing is still adorable ; i dare anyone not to smile ad a cuddly cub doing a belly slide down a snowy embankment . that bear is sympathetic and entertaining in a way his human co-stars can never hope to be , and he is the real star of alaska . he just doesn't have any supporting players . that points up a significant drawback in a film which is supposed to be a wilderness adventure , namely that there is not enough wilderness , especially in the first half . there is plenty of photography of majestic locations ( of a strangely flat variety by cinematographer tony westman ) , but fraser c . heston doesn't quite know what to do with it . it is fine for a family adventure like alaska to turn in only a rudimentary plot provided it delivers the thrills , and they finally start coming with about half an hour left . that last half hour is very exciting , though , with a white water sequence as impressive as anything in the river wild and a literal cliff-hanger of a climax . by then , over 70 minutes into alaska , young viewers could be getting might restless . _that's_ a story i really would have enjoyed , and i couldn't help wondering why alaska hadn't tripled its polar bear content much earlier . 
the quinn brothers' this is my father is such an obvious labor of love that it is a shame that it doesn't have more depth . primarily set in a 1939 ireland that seems a half-century earlier still , the film waxes nostalgic for a time that probably never was except in books and motion pictures . starring aidan quinn as kieran o'dea , written with studied simplicity and directed with slow deliberateness by brother paul and filmed in warm tones by brother declan , the movie lists all three as executive producers . as a one-hour episode on television's masterpiece theater , the story's limitations would not have been so obvious . but at a full two hours , the thinnest of the plot and the reliance on stereotypes can get a bit tiresome . all of this notwithstanding , the cast's heartfelt performances raise the picture above the hackneyed storyline . flynn is a spunky lass with a bewitching smile who charms the pants off of o'dea . the movie is full of incidents and plot contrivances that make little sense . in another such disingenuous moment , stephen rea shows up as a fire-and-brimstone priest who , in the confines of the confessional , demands to hear all of the lurid details of o'dea's sexual sins . not content to learn of what o'dea did , the priest , wanting more titillation , insists on knowing everything the sinner would like to do as well . our full audience had one woman who laughed regularly and another who snored loudly , while the rest sat there in almost total silence . slightly humorous and a little poignant , this small movie tells a simple story without many flourishes . still , the grace and earnestness of the performances give the relentlessly corny film a soul that makes it more than the sum of its cliched characters . this is my father runs 2 : 00 . it is rated r for a little profanity and a brief sex scene and would be fine for teenagers . 
fools rush in is a romantic comedy about the clash of the mexican and anglo cultures . the basic ingredients are present , but it takes more than good looks to make a love story and more than tacky sets to create a comedy . although after seeing it you may think the title fools rush in refers to the audience's entrance , it actually refers to two people getting married quickly without thinking through the consequences . " that's good " , she says , " because i choose to keep the baby . " the meeting setup is a cornucopia of cliches . the house is decorated with the tackiest collection of mexican artifacts i have ever seen in a film . if it were either genuine or if they have tried for parody , it might have worked , but as delivered , the jokes fell like stones . " i had no idea that families talked at dinner . " the script by katherine reback relies on ideas that are retreads . my reaction to this scene and , indeed to most of the film was to stare in disbelief . the picture does have two unique features . it is the first film that i can remember in which the characters in vegas are smart enough to leave that most plastic of cities and take a day trip to one of the great natural wonders of the world , the grand canyon . consistent with the quality of the rest of the picture , however , it is also the first film that manages to make the grand canyon look unimpressive and dull . they accomplish this feat by overexposing the image and by rushing the shooting and not waiting for the proper natural light . the filming of the grand canyon sequence yields another possible interpretation of the film's title . fools rush in runs about an hour and a half . it is rated pg-13 for some profanity and for sexual situations . the show would be fine for kids 10 and up . i found little fresh or funny material in the show , so thumbs down from me . i give it * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
she has the delightful look of a geriatric pixie . albert brooks is one of the best comedic actors , directors and writers in america today . his brilliance in this picture shines through as he does all three roles with grace and perfect timing . together they fashion an intelligent script so funny that a few times i laughed so hard that i almost made myself sick . although it did not make mine , it is a comedic gem . what i like even better than the humor in the story is the freshness of the character of the mother . usually , strong mothers like beatrice dissolve into jewish mother cliches with lots of overbearing lines delivered with heavy overacting . this is not at all the character that reynolds gives us . " we just have sex occasionally . " no more food . it's like fantasia . " john is a science fiction writer , but not a particularly successful one . they have changed the words to match mother's plot , but i will not reveal any of them . the biggest problem i had with the movie occurred 1 : 35 into the picture . i suddenly realized that the movie was about to end . i was upset . i had grown to like these people and did not want them to leave me . since i pride myself in warning my readers about shows that can prove troubling , let me do just the opposite with mother . i want to allay your fears . the ads clearly and accurately reassure us that , " no mothers were harmed during the making of this motion picture . " some movies work best for certain audiences . i think this film has a wide appeal , but for those of us with mothers of beatrice's age , it holds an extra fascination . my mother is not at all like beatrice , but she has the same diminutive size and approximate age as reynolds , so in the scenes with beatrice just barely seeing over the steering wheel i got several extra chuckles . although i invited my wife to the press screening and she loved the movie too , i probably should have invited my mother instead . on the other hand , i still remember when i was twelve and invited my mother to this new hitchcock film called psycho . when the nude shower scene suddenly came up , i was really worried about what she would think of me for inviting her to see such as a show . it worked out fine , but i still remember my fear -- not of the scene , but of having lost face with someone i respected . mothers are like that . it is rated pg-13 for the mature themes and some mild profanity . there is no sex , nudity , or violence . the show would be fine for kids say ten and up . i recommend this charming comedy to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : january 7 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
in the wonderfully sardonic detention , by writer/director andy anderson ( positive i . d . ) , the bored students know that they can get away with absolutely anything . it seems that 2 parents got an injunction after they found some material objectionable in the current books . this smartly kafkaesque tale has two distinct parts . the darkly comedic first part is followed by a shockingly dramatic second , each fascinating in its own right , but both better together . the comedy works because the excellent ensemble cast takes it dead seriously , and the drama works better because of the comedic relief . both are helped by being outlandish yet frequently quite plausible , as any teacher , especially substitute teachers , will tell you . mr . walmsley , who rarely raises his voice , correctly points out . the school's attorneys have determined the recommended number of teacher-to-student eye-contacts -- 8 per student per class since more would constitute sexual harassment and less would be evidence of discrimination . the challenging story , which asks thought-provoking and provocative questions , is willing to tackle difficult subjects in surprising ways . the director , who is as engaging and hilarious as his movie and who was at our screening , told us of the reaction of a friend of his who had seen the film : " if you're a kid , it's a horror movie ; if you're an adult , it's a fantasy . " it has not yet been submitted to the mpaa for a rating . although it contains full male and female frontal nudity and violence , the director told me that he believes that it will be able to receive an r without cuts since there is no sexuality associated with the nudity . the film would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
cast : kevin zegers , wendy makkena , michael jeter , bill cobbs , eric christmas director : charles martin smith producers : robert vince and william vince screenplay : aaron mendelson , paul tamasy cinematography : mike southon music : braham wenger u . s . distributor : walt disney pictures when you consider motion picture concepts that never should make it past the planning stage , a dog playing basketball has to be near the top of the list ( alongside a remake of casablanca and a big-screen version of leave it to beaver ) . nevertheless , because this is disney , a company that's never met a dumb animal movie premise it didn't like , air bud not only survived development hell , but emerged to plague the late summer box office . someone should consider a law banning disney from making sports- related movies . i still shudder every time i think of their angels in the outfield remake . the mighty ducks movies are the worst examples of crass commercialization . somewhere along the way , disney confused " family entertainment " with " mindless stupidity . " air bud starts out like a severely watered-down version of the recent ( and infinitely better ) shiloh . in actuality , the first hour of air bud is watchable , since all it's doing is recycling diluted elements from shiloh and hoosiers . does snively get what he deserves ? does anyone not know the answers to these questions ? early during the end credits , air bud makes note of the fact that " no special visual effects were used in the filming of the basketball sequences . " that's fine , but , to involve me in a movie , something a little more impressive is required than a dog that can bounce a ball off its nose . there is no attempt to fashion anything more ambitious or interesting than an obligatory storyline around this circus act . and director charles martin smith makes some ill-advised choices in developing air bud's tone . for the most part , the movie is presented as a simplistic melodrama that takes itself far too seriously ( with occasional , unfunny instances of slapstick comedy thrown in at odd moments ) . a movie featuring a basketball playing dog should probably use a somewhat less earnest approach to its subject matter . in the acting department , the weakest performer is the human lead , kevin zegers . zegers is adequate at best , but , at a time when there are an increasing number of superlative adolescent actors , that's not good enough . in zegers' defense , however , it should be noted that it's difficult to give an effective performance while constantly being upstaged by a dog . meanwhile , michael jeter is irritating as snively -- watching his scenes is akin to enduring someone scraping their fingernails across a blackboard . the screenplay is credited to aaron mendelson and paul tamasy , and it's astonishing that the attention of two writers was needed to fill in the blanks of this by-the-numbers script . once upon a time , i emerged from movies like this thinking that i could easily pen something with more originality and intelligence . what i eventually realized , however , was that those qualities are not what studios like disney are looking for in their family fare . they want familiarity and banality , and air bud wears both of those characteristics with the comfort and fit of a second skin . 
call it jurassic park jr . , although it's likely to appeal only to a small fraction of the audience that enjoyed steven spielberg's summer mega-hit . where that one was a thrill-a-minute ride filled with spectacular effects and well-orchestrated tension , we're back is an exercise in endurance--not only is it on the dull side , but it has such an overwhelming sense of sweetness that it threatens to become nauseating . it's adults accompanying their offspring who will have problems because , even considering the short length of the film , this is the visual equivalent of a sominex . to say that there's not much of interest going on is an understatement . while the plot is adequate for the under-ten group , it won't do much to satisfy the older viewer . hopefully we're back's single musical number , a nicely jaunty tune , is sufficient to keep the eyelids open . the premise is simple ( and simple-minded ) . with a talented writer like john patrick shanley ( moonstruck ) at the keyboard , i expected more than this trite , vacuous effort . sure , there's an occasional line thrown in for the adults , but that hardly makes the experience worthwhile . the best animated films are those that have something for viewers of all ages . over the years , disney's films have proven that " animation " doesn't equate with " juvenile . " the creators of we're back didn't learn the lesson , so their product turns out to be an overly-long , big screen cartoon . the animation is serviceable , and occasionally above-average . the limitations of a " quickie job " are often apparent , but there are a few nice sequences when it appears that some effort was put into the visual aspects of the story . whoever picked the voices for we're back made some unusual choices , none of which leads to an impressive or inspired performance . mr . cronkite gets an opportunity to say " and that's the way it is . . . " , but i don't recall ms . child ever making mention of " bon appetite . " in a year when there's no new offering from disney , the temptation is to search for something to fill the void . parents should not be fooled into thinking they're getting anything in the same league . if they don't mind fighting off a desire to snooze , their kids probably will enjoy this movie . it's an unfortunate choice to have to make . 
cast : federico luppi , dan rivera gonzalez , damian delgado , tania cruz , damian alcazar , mandy patinkin , kathryn grody director : john sayles producers : maggie renzi , r . paul miller screenplay : john sayles cinematography : slawomir idziak music : mason daring u . s . distributor : sony pictures classics in spanish with subtitles his films -- those that he writes , directs , and edits -- are made entirely outside of the studio system . sayles broke onto the scene in 1980 with his directorial debut , return of the secaucus seven , the movie that inspired the better-known the big chill . while perhaps not as masterful as lone star , men with guns is nevertheless a very good film . politics are meaningless . and , while there is a legitimate argument for " naming names " , sayles' point is that the themes and issues he addresses are universal in nature , and that there's no reason to pin down a specific country . sayles presents men with guns from fuentes' perspective -- the doctor represents the audience . he is blas ? about murder and torture -- those are common aspects of his day-to-day existence . it is a credit to sayles that he creates five vivid , three- dimensional characters in two hours . in actuality , the film runs a little long ( this often happens when a director edits his own material , since he can be reluctant to cut certain potentially unnecessary scenes ) . the performances are all good , and , although the acting in many spanish-language films tends towards over-the-top melodrama , sayles keeps his actors focused so that their work is relatively low-key . two americans , mandy patinkin and kathryn grody , have small-but-important parts . their characters serve a dual purpose -- to provide much-needed comic relief and to illustrate how it's possible to be focused on the past but oblivious to the present . reduced to broad generalizations , men with guns is an adventure story -- a sort of don quixote meets hearts of darkness . what marks this film as special isn't just that the surface details are believable , but that there is great richness and breadth to the issues addressed within . while men with guns ends on an artificially uplifting note , the prevailing tone is one of bleak hopelessness . this is a thought-provoking motion picture that , like many of sayles' other efforts , demands that we ponder complex questions . - ingmar bergman 
while star kid isn't based on a comic book , it might as well be . however , unlike most superhero action movies , which aspire to be embraced by viewers of all ages , this feature is aimed at an exclusive sex and age group : preteen boys . but , while the picture is likely to appeal to many members of the target audience , those on the outside may be irritated by star kid's silly humor , flat characters , and juvenile writing . when it comes to live-action comic books , this is uninspired fare . giggles ) , most of what goes on during star kid is strictly generic and by-the-book . it's worth noting that , while the special effects aren't state of the art , they're pretty impressive considering the film's low budget . if you're looking for top-notch acting by " name " stars , this isn't the right movie . the most impressive performance in star kid is given by a special effect ( cy ) . joseph mazzello is adequate as spencer , but his work here doesn't come close to his impressive turn in shadowlands ; instead , it's more in line with his listless jurassic park output . the other actors are adequate , and one or two of the faces may look vaguely familiar , but no one is likely to get another job based exclusively on their dubious accomplishments here . if the premise -- a human being gaining superpowers as a result of a special costume ? sounds familiar , that could be because it was the idea behind last year's shaquille o'neal feature , steel . however , while the basic plot is a retread , at least the dialogue transcends the level of nonstop , predictable clich ? s . although there's nothing in star kid that's likely to be mistaken for modern-day shakespeare , surprisingly few of the lines are cringingly awful . in fact , from time to time , the characters in this movie speak like real people . one thing that star kid has going for it is that it's rarely boring ( although the repetitious climactic battle goes on for about 10 minutes too long ) . that's because of the notoriously short attention span of the target audience . twenty years ago , i suppose i would have enjoyed this movie . since then , however , my tastes have matured , and now i demand a little more intelligence and sophistication than star kid offers . unless you're a boy between the ages of about 8 and 13 , you're likely to find little of interest in this picture . - ingmar bergman 
how can a bad film be good ? well , in the hands of edgar g . ulmer , it is possible to end a film with an overbearing melodramatic paranoia to it , on the edgy words of the protagonist , who wonders to himself how , " fate could put the finger on you and me for no good reason at all , " and not be laughed at as pretentious dialogue . instead , this work becomes a memorable cult film that can so easily in lesser hands than the skilled ulmer , have fallen into the realm of inanity , but here becomes a strong film about the meaning of fate . what is most amazing , though , is that this film was shot in six days in a poverty row studio on an extremely low budget , without an attempt to get any location shots for a story that centers around a cross-country hitchhiking trip , and yet it remains gritty and realistic even if the film is full of technical errors . it remains fully a part of the rich history of b&w noir films . it is also an example of what the big studios can't seem to do well , how in their attempt to make a film that is pleasing to a large market share of the audience , they too often lose track of how interesting a story can be without the usual formula applied to it or the need for making it glitzy , and they fail to get into the soul of their stars , where they should have been going in the first place . which might explain how this poorly acted , weakly-crafted story , was so much applauded by film buffs that it has reached classical cult status in film lore and is even revered by certain noted directors such as martin scorsese , and was held-up by the french movie critics as a work of true art when they discovered the neglected film in 1950 . in a voiceover , he asks , " did you ever want to forget anything and can't because there is always something that comes up to remind you of what you were trying to forget ? " the most memorable part of the film , the part that seemed the eeriest and most convincing comes next , as al starts to panic and can't think clearly . he goes over in his mind the choices he has , as he keeps saying to himself who would believe me if i told them what happened : 1 ) my first instinct tells me to run . 2 ) the next possibility is to sit tight and wait for the cops . his weak character and not his criminal act of stealing haskell's identity are the cause of his downfall . ulmer has created an unusually bleak character study , that plays like a mesmerizing confession , as the hero has the intangible quality of innocence going for him , which adds a seductive quality to his character for those in the audience , such as me , who can appreciate his natural inclination not to trust the authorities , even when that seems to be the most rational thing to do in the dire predicament he was in . to understand that , is to begin to understand the power of a noir film , probably the most original cinematic work the american film industry has produced . the noir hero is just not like the other hollywood heroes ; he does not see the world in technicolor . 
u . s . availability : general release 4/7/95 running length : mpaa classification : pg-13 ( mature themes , nudity , profanity ) with the exception of a few small parts--some good ( a dry white season , the freshman ) and some terrible ( christopher columbus : the discovery ) -- the man once hailed as the greatest american actor has eschewed leading roles . don juan demarco is a lighthearted , frothy fable about romance and the way a patient's fantasies affect his doctor's reality . despite several astute lines which give the film an intellectual appeal , this is not an exceptionally deep movie . the playful , often humorous tone , coupled with don juan's accent , suggests the princess bride . writer/director jeremy leven takes pleasure in clouding the division between what's real and what isn't , but he never stretches matters to such an extreme that don juan demarco is reduced to a mindless farce . johnny depp is appealing as the latin lover , but the truly meaty role belongs to brando . there's nothing overtly original in the character , but brando shows he can still give a strong performance . this is far from his best work , but he's more than a match for the part , and brings to jack a human quality that encourages compassion and empathy . there is proof here-- as if any is really needed--that couples don't have to be under thirty to capture an audience's heart . with so much blurring between reality and fantasy , there are bound to be a few missteps , but leven keeps these to a minimum , and the film is mostly a success in its approach to its themes . " of what is the spirit made ? " , the proposed answer to all is " love " , that singular emotion which pervades this disarming motion picture . 
movies about mormon missionaries might seem likely to get the same reaction from non-believers . in the case of god's army , viewers who shut the cinematic equivalent of the door in its face will be depriving themselves of a surprisingly good film about faith and dedication . like a high quality blend of a documentary and an after-school television special , this low-budget , fictional film creates a host of interesting characters and provides a lot of surprising background on what it means to be a mormon missionary . although you may have never given them a second thought , they don't have an easy vocation . " isn't it funny how a few short days can change your whole life forever ? " he tells us in voice-over in the opening . ( there are too many references to the wizard of oz in the script , which otherwise , is sharp , intelligent and humorous . ) it's an interesting metaphor and one of many in the thought-provoking script . always polite but not one easy to say " no " to , he has answers for all occasions . " i think that if you're not interested in what we have to say , then you must not know what we have to say , " he tells one person who naively thinks that expressing non-interest will make the missionaries leave . there is certainly one thing that isn't likely to come to mind when people think of mormon missionaries , and that is that they could be big practical jokesters -- not to their would-be converts , but to themselves . in a movie that is frequently quite funny , one of the best scenes has a guy telling elder allen on his first day that he is going to get his gun if they don't leave . the story doesn't skirt difficult issues . the role of women and minorities are discussed as well . the good-spirited and informative picture is well-cast throughout even if the acting is sometimes amateurish . a moving and quite funny film , it isn't at all what you might expect . but be warned : after seeing it you may not be able to quite so efficaciously shoo missionaries from your doorstep . knowing more about them makes them more human and more deserving of basic human politeness . it is rated pg for thematic elements and some language and would be fine for anyone old enough to be interested in the subject matter . 
as it turns out , the only thing of real importance in a man of no importance is albert finney's performance . his turn as bus conductor alfie byrne is yet another extraordinary credit to add to an already- impressive resume . the man who played tom jones in the 1960s has matured into one of the best character actors of the 1990s , with memorable appearances in such films as the playboys , rich in love , and the browning version . even when these movies had little to offer , finney's presence was a saving grace . when he's not entertaining his regular passengers with readings of oscar wilde , alfie is a would-be director who delights in putting on not-so-successful amateur productions . but alfie's personal life isn't nearly as joyful as his public personae might lead others to believe . if a man of no importance is anything other than a nicely-detailed portrait of one unfulfilled middle-aged dubliner , it's about the value of friendship . perhaps the most glaring flaw a man of no importance is the weakness of the framing storyline . alfie is such an interesting character that he deserves a more original plot . a man of no importance takes only " safe " risks , avoiding reaching for something new or groundbreaking . there's a familiarity to the material , and only so much an accomplished actor can do with the script . " the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it , " wrote oscar wilde , but when alfie tries to apply this lesson , the results are--to put it mildly--unfortunate . that life cannot be lived without risk and failure is certainly one of a man of no importance's more emphatic messages . and it's the choice of albert finney far more than any other element of the production that allows this aspect of the movie--as well as others--to succeed . 
you don't have to worry about focus , lighting or subject material ; you just point your camcorder and shoot . editing is basically unnecessary , and you can just play the tape wherever you left off last . after all , your only intended audience is your friends , who are already predisposed to like it anyway . i had never heard of phish before this movie , which may reveal something about my age . not having previous interest in a subject , however , should be no hindrance . i had never thought much about electric chair construction or about the grunge rock movement , but the documentaries about them , errol morris's mr . death and doug pray's hype ! , were absolutely engrossing . in contrast , bittersweet motel is so formless that i began to wonder if the projectionist might have scrambled the reels . the documentary is as generic as the band it follows . their bland music reminds me of the sort of things that i hear playing from the ceiling while lying in the dentist's chair . it is relaxing but completely forgettable . but , just because the band isn't the next rolling stones , it does not follow that a documentary about them has to be so lifeless . we clearly see that this good-spirited group , described as dorks by some of their loyal fans , does enjoy their work . the members of phish certainly don't take themselves too seriously . this is about as insightful as this movie ever gets . in summary , bittersweet motel is for phish fans only . bittersweet motel runs what feels like a very long 1 : 20 . it is not rated but would be an r for brief instances of language , drug usage and mass nudity . absent these brief sections , the movie is pure g . it would be fine for teenagers . 
a risky commercial venture that sometimes works in a serious way but is somewhat beaten down by the lack of vision it exhibits while in its romantic mode , as opposed to how alluring it was as a moralistic survival film . the film is carried solely by tom hanks' splendid performance , with him reflecting without the need of dramatics or dialogue the changes he is going through , as he acts through use of facial expressions and body language . the adventure story is reminiscent of a modern-day robinson crusoe tale , and is divided into three distinct parts , with tom hanks being the film's mainstay . the striking visuals and penetrating silence , give this film a surprising depth to its storytelling . he converses with it as if it were a human companion . there were times that this island fare seemed mildly poetic , but at other times it began to wear heavy as time dragged with only tom hanks on the screen to keep the fire going . yet the film had a certain appeal to it . . . a boldness not often seen in commercial films , as it bravely did without dialogue for great parts of the island story . this lent a certain sense of unpredictability to it and made the simple story lend itself to being more introspective and interestingly perceived . the major fault of the film lies in the capricious ending , where it ran out of story and didn't know how to make hanks' return to memphis and civilization shed some light on what he's been through without trivializing that experience . but what didn't resonate was the ambiguity of the film's ending . that is the simple point the film is trying to make and where the film should have ended , but when it tries to reinforce its sappy love story with characters who had too little screen time to have an effect on the story and it forces corny words on those characters in order to resolve hanks' love situation , the film thereby loses something by its hollywoodish formulaic message it tries desperately to land safely on . otherwise , a pleasing film from the director of forrest gump , robert zemeckis . one of his better ones . . . with the adventure part of the film having some appeal though not delving deep enough into the survivor's psyche for it to have an even greater appeal . but it was far superior to that recently popular survivor tv show , which had more to do about making a million bucks than surviving . 
indeed , the musical numbers are the film's best part , even if none come close to being memorable . mitchell kriegman's script is the movie's weakest link , giving the film slightly less punch than a typical television episode from the series . in our packed audience , filled with kids from toddlers on up , the laugh quotient was remarkably modest . typical of the picture's humor is the location of the villain's home -- it's " high atop mount pick-a-nose . " kriegman throws the adults in the audience a few random funny lines . with its 3 to 5-year-old target audience , the movie stops the action , literally , whenever anything threatening occurs . also interactive , the movie requires audience participation , lest bad things happen to its protagonist . elmo , for example , needs us to come up with 100 raspberries in less than 30 seconds to convince the queen of trash ( vanessa l . williams ) that he isn't a cohort of the nefarious huxley ( mandy patinkin ) . the movie keeps a dynamic count on the screen , so you may want to practice in advance . even if the film isn't all it could be , some scenes are special . the most magical is one filled with fireflies . it is rated g and would be fine for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 10 , gave it * * , liking mainly the music . his friend alan , age 10 , gave it * * * , finding the movie hilarious but the plot weak . 
children of heaven ( bacheha-ye aseman ) , written and directed by majid majidi , is less a movie than a visual pantomime of a short story . the thin narrative and sparse dialog almost dares critics not to like it by imbuing just about every character with near sainthood . add in the amateurish acting , and you would seem to have a recipe for a film that will cause people to smile politely and try think of kind things to say . the director does fashion a few nice visuals . another lovely little image has kids blowing soap bubbles at each other . too often , however , he runs out of ideas and just films the same ugly alleyway , again and again . using little dialog , the film sticks to the visuals to tell the bulk of its story . the movie's best sequence occurs when the father gets inside the gates and views the exterior of one of the elaborate homes . many obvious questions are never answered . the movie does contain one amazing scene . we actually see the kids doing homework ! kids all over america do this everyday -- except in american movies . children of heaven runs just 1 : 28 . the film is in persian with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be a g since nothing even remotely offensive occurs . the picture would be fine for all ages , but kids would probably need to be at least 9 to be interested . 
what if you had married your mr . ( or ms . ) right ? what would your life be like now ? would it be a dream or a nightmare ? in writer/director pip karmel's me myself i , pamela drury gets to find out . or does it ? griffiths does a masterful job of portraying pam's fear and jubilation . " mom , if you don't get your period , do you have to use a condom if you're having sex , " stacey asks in a casual hall conversation . here is a girl who does not need to earn extra money . the biggest surprise with the script is the way it subtly transforms the movie from a breezy little comedy into something more substantial . by the end we find ourselves , along with pam , pondering significant issues ranging from self-actualization to the importance of love and family . me myself i is a gentle movie that works its magic more by the small turns in the plot than the large ones . by the end , you'll be rooting for pam , while still not sure what is best for her . the story's resolution is handled nicely and with just the right amount of ambiguity . me myself i runs 1 : 44 . it is rated r for sexuality and some language and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
lewton's fingerprints are all over the literary script that was made into an intelligent , well-crafted and bizarre thriller . it is noirish in attitude and gothic in tone , enhanced by dark shadowy cinematography and mark robson's crisp direction , which brings about a mixture of ominous danger and a feel for the offbeat . it opens with a grim john donne poem to set the stage for the upcoming action , " i run to death , and death meets me as fast , and all my pleasures are like yesterday . . . " . it's easy to dismiss the film's flaws , such as cramming too much story into such a short time frame of 71 minutes , but it is better to concentrate on the artfully told b-film and all the personal touches found that make the film so clever . when viewed that way , this low-budget film is simply superb , equal to producer val lewton's " cat people " ( 42 ) . for its time period of the 1940s , it bravely touches on suicide as a necessary part of the plot and covers satanic cults in a mature manner , by showing that ordinary types can join such a cult . 
screenplay : woody allen . director : woody allen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . woody allen is one of the unlikeliest film-makers i can think of to try to revive the movie musical . it is true that allen has made nostalgia something of his personal fiefdom , and that he clearly loves the old standards , but that doesn't necessarily make him the best man for the job . to oversimplify the matter somewhat , the near-total disappearance of the musical as a cinematic genre has been the product of a less innocent era ; for a musical to work its magic on you , you had to surrender to its often-absurd optimism , something increasingly difficult to do in a cynical time . woody allen may not necessarily be a cynic , but he has become somewhat synonymous with sophistication . everyone says i love you is an entertaining trifle which never truly transports you because allen is too often outside the genre . this may be the first meta-musical . everyone says i love you deals with the complicated romantic entanglements of an upscale extended family . everyone says i love you is an experiment , to be sure , with most of the actors singing their own parts and production numbers popping up in the oddest places . a couple of the numbers work superbly , notably a ghostly dance to " enjoy yourself ( it's later than you think ) " which is reminiscent of disneyland's haunted mansion , but watching this film makes you realize how long it may have been since you've seen characters break into song on screen ; even though you know it is a musical , it is a bit startling every time a song begins . the problem with everyone says i love you isn't the songs , it is allen's approach to them . his audience is notoriously upscale , and he makes his films decidedly with that audience in mind ; how better to explain the knowing laughter which accompanies a cameo appearance by itzhak perlman playing violin at a party ? in fact , knowing laughter plays a significant role in everyone says i love you . allen appears to be banking not on the songs and dances themselves being entertaining , but on their silly incongruity being entertaining . one moment , a light-hearted duet between goldie hawn and woody allen on the banks of the seine , strikes a perfect low-key tone , but it is a rare exception . allen has made a comedy in which the object of much of the humor is the fact that people are singing and dancing ; he is getting us to laugh _at_ the musical genre , not with it . one of the ironies of that effect is that allen may also have given a winking acknowledgment to critics of his romanticized view of new york . there is plenty to laugh at in everyone says i love you , from skylar's propensity for swallowing engagement rings to one hilarious swipe at italians from a teutonic housekeeper , as well as inspired performances by edward norton ( effortlessly charming in his two musical numbers ) and tim roth ( hilarious as a suspicious criminal thrust into high society ) . curiously , those two performances also emphasize why everyone says i love you isn't better . they offer a couple of rare moments of unrestrained glee in a story which feels constrained by its characters' social positions , even though allen is all too conscious of the world in which he has set his story . it is noteworthy that the marx brothers play a significant role in the film's climax ( as well as the title , a tune prominently featured in horse feathers ) , because everyone says i love you is a musical in the sense that the marx brothers' early films were musicals , where songs serving romantic sub-plots only got in the way of the real funny material . it is also set in the posh world the marxes used to tear to shreds , only the classy folks are the heroes this time . everyone says i love you sings , but it might have soared if the guiding sensibility had been groucho instead of margaret dumont . 
belle de jour is a classic french film from 1967 that has been out of release for a couple of decades . belle de jour is by the famous director luis bunuel and stars the equally famous catherine deneuve as severine sevigny . her bouts of prostitution again feature s & m which is attempted to be presented as great fun and very playful . for anyone wanting a more serious treatment of prostitution , they should see the excellent , albeit quite depressing , 1986 movie working girls by lizzie borden . i'll let you find out the rest of the story by seeing the movie . i found the story unbelievable and very dated . i know the critics are going gaga over its rerelease . i do not buy it . she looks pretty degraded and unhappy to me even though she does start to smile some toward the end of the film . i thought the performance of all the actors , most especially that of deneuve , was wooden . it was as if the director wanted more of a tableaux that a motion picture . to the fans of this show , i say they can have it , i want nothing of it . belle de jour runs 1 : 40 which , with its loose editing by louisette hautecoeur , keep making me want to shout " okay , lets get this scene moving . " it is in french , but the english subtitles are easy to follow . it is correctly rated r for sadomasochism . there is little sex and almost no nudity . it would be okay for mature teenagers . i do not recommend the show , but i do give it * 1/2 for attempting to be innovative in its time . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
a slight melodramatic story , but an efficiently made moral tale with noir overtures . this film does a good job of poking holes at that dream , showing underneath the surface all is not well . but the nightmare indicates more than that , as it indicates there is something troubling even the youngsters brought up in this so-called ideal materialistic environment . 
the set is bristling with problems and tension . while the topical story is about the business and cynicism involved in making a picture , and the vanity of those in the field , its deeper concern is with understanding the personal nature of failure , insecurity , and disappointment . the film borders on soap opera but manages to get beyond it because of the intelligent discretion of minnelli in his directing and the fine acting from the two male leads , with robinson's performance being nothing short of brilliant , enough to lift this film on his shoulders alone to a loftier dimension . 
if it hadn't been for john glenn's recent space flight at age 77 , the plot might seem completely ridiculous . instead , the script makes the old team's goal and flight seem remarkably plausible . ( these " geriatric " astronauts are supposed to be about 69 , but you'll notice that in real-life jones is a good bit younger at 53 . beautifully directed by eastwood , the movie has two distinct parts . the first half is an inviting and good-spirited comedy , that is deliciously underplayed and that rarely dissolves into slapstick . the second half is an exhilarating action drama set in space . just watching these old actors work together is worth the price of admission . the brightly written script by ken kaufman and howard klausner successfully creates four unique lead characters . he's a take-no-guff kind of guy . " go ahead , take your best shot . " corvin , your country needs you , " ethan argues . " put a sock in it , sonny ! " " maybe you should try to get your money back ! " frank retorts with a classic eastwood sneer that would melt steel . the four's creative fudging supplies many of the best laughs . there is also a fatalistic humor in that everyone they ask about seems to have died . rivaling eastwood for the movie's best performance is tommy lee jones , as daredevil pilot hawk . no one can fly a plane as well as hawk , but there's been bad blood between frank and hawk for 40 years now . there are lots of subplots , including a romance between hawk and a nasa engineer ( marcia gay harden ) , and most of them work quite well without needlessly complicating the story . the film's special effects are quite credible . looking authentic but not overly glamorous , they nicely compliment the story rather than dominating it . what a wonderful contrast this movie makes with typical movie fare these days . rather than having another in our weekly releases of bad-to-mediocre teen comedies , we have an intelligent and funny picture featuring people who have real acting experience that's measured in decades , not years . let's hope that this starts a trend away from bad movies , whose only claim to fame is their demographics , and toward good films with experienced , really experienced , actors . it's probably too much to hope for . after all , we've raised a generation who thinks that all movies end in a prom sequence , and that all jokes must involve crude references to some bodily fluid . it is rated pg-13 for some language and would be fine for kids around 9 and up . it is also a good movie to take multiple generations to see . it's the kind of film that it's fun to view again . 
screenplay : david koepp , based on the novel by michael crichton . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence ) running time : 127 minutes . sure , the lizards in question were not entirely mechanical , but i got the point . it also turns out to be , more or less , more of the same . the lost world offers all the shallow characterization and pointless plotting of jurassic park without the sense of discovery . only in the hands of steven spielberg could that recipe add up to something moderately diverting instead of a compete disaster . in many ways , the lost world is actually an improvement over jurassic park , if for no other reason than that it is more honest . spielberg takes exactly two minutes to show us the first dinosaur in the lost world , clearly aware that there's no point in creating build-up any longer . he also takes a note from a clever line in david koepp's script given to malcolm : " yeah , ooh ahh . . . that's always how it starts . jurassic park was almost obliged to provide the wide-eyed wonder of the completely new ; the lost world , appropriately , delivers a much higher ratio of " running and screaming " to " ooh ahh . " it also doesn't have laura dern as a dumber-than-triceratops-dung paleobotanist , giggling like a schoolgirl over malcolm's description of chaos theory , or ariana richards shrieking about unix systems . what the lost world _does_ have is a generous helping of scenes and characters which are awfully familiar . pete postlethwaite plays this year's version of the great white hunter while arliss howard plays this year's version of the corporate scum ; the gallimimus stampede of jp becomes lost world's parasauralophus stampede . even the sequence of attacks feels derivative : t . rex attacks a vehicle and tries to push it over a cliff , t . rex chases people , people trek toward a distant goal , velociraptors take their turn . jurassic park was more enjoyable than it should have been because we had never seen this stuff before . lost world is the same stuff , just in greater quantities . those greater quantities are probably going to satisfy movie-goers who like their action fast and furious , with minimal interruption for silly little things like character development . no one will argue that that the lost world is much more than a string of set pieces ; there is also little question that a few of those set pieces are directed with that indescribable spielberg something . when spielberg is " on , " the results can be dizzying , and he's " on " just often enough to give the lost world a few satisfying sparks . like us , he's been there and done that . i believe i have seen jurassic park four times since its initial release , and i have enjoyed it less each time . if i had seen the lost world for the first time in 1993 -- if the order of the two films had been reversed -- i suspect i would have found it positively thrilling . in 1997 , it's just like watching jurassic park for the fifth time , when it's hard to get worked up over a film which has little going for it besides big mechanical lizards . 
he was replaced in the film by wheeler oakman , who doesn't have much of a part . the story was a conventional hero against villain one , but the film had a certain splendor about it that elevated its melodramatics . 
walking and talking is another one of those talkfest shows . with the right script these can be among the most enjoyable and rewarding of any cinematic experience . from my dinner with andre to diner to before sunrise , this is a genre of which i have always been especially fond . thanks to an energetic cast this movie tries hard and almost delivers . sad to say that the directing and writing by nicole holofcener is not of the same caliber . this is not a bad show just a disappointing one . it is one that keeps your attention and never drags . the show is so completely natural that it borders on amateurishness at times . the actors are all good , and it is an ensemble cast , but , on the whole , the show promises more than it delivers . the script is just not intelligent enough , and there are no memorable lines . i like the characters and the acting , but there is just not quite enough there . it is rated r . there is more bad language than there needs to be , and there is a single brief drug scene . there is no sex , nudity , or violence . even the skinny-dipping scene is done with their underwear on . the show would be fine for any teenager . it is a marginal call , but there is not enough substance for me to be able to recommend it . i give it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
screenplay : ed solomon , based on the comic book by lowell cunningham . producers : walter f . parkes and laurie macdonald . director : barry sonnenfeld . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence ) running time : 98 minutes . if batman & robin arrived as the summer film everyone was ready to hate , men in black arrived as the film everyone was ready to love . this was to be the antidote to a season filled with moribund sequels and lackluster high concepts , a cinematic life preserver for movie-goers drowning in over-promoted and under-developed bilge water blockbusters . it would bring together an appealing rising star , a savvy veteran character actor , an idiosyncratic director , a clever concept and fun visual effects . this , at last , would be something worth standing in line for . men in black the movie -- as opposed to men in black the much-anticipated event -- isn't worth standing in line for . it's a frisky , fairly enjoyable summer fantasy , one which avoids the common big-budget trap of over-staying its welcome . at the same time , it's a bit disappointing , and for an unexpected reason . men in black has been edited to the point where scenes collide awkwardly , where attempts at sub-plots cry out for more development . it's a film which actually _under_-stays its welcome . that says a lot for what is on the screen for just over 90 minutes . their responsibility is overseeing the earth's alien population -- alien , as in the extra-terrestrial kind -- as well as keeping the existence of those aliens secret from the general population . when director barry sonnenfeld plays that premise for its most outrageous and witty comic possibilities , men in black is a whole lot of fun . jones and smith have a solid rapport in a variation on the standard buddy-cop pairing , turning in performances which are knowing without winking too obviously at the audience . their supporting cast is sharp as well , particularly vincent d'onofrio in a hilarious turn as the sadistic alien bug who inhabits the skin of a redneck farmer ; d'onofrio's physical movements are even more hideously other-worldly than rick baker's make-up effects . the grandest , goofiest moments involve mib headquarters , rendered by bo welch's production design and eric brevig's visual effects as a cross between kennedy airport , ellis island and mos eisley spaceport . that wry charm , along with the collected talent in men in black , should have been enough to justify the hype . and so they might have been , if sonnenfeld had put together a film with a momentum to match its moments . the plot races from place to place so quickly that you're never given a chance to piece it together . as a collection of amusing individual scenes , men in black is just fine . it just never makes sense when precious minutes are devoted to half-hearted attempts at character development . it's not fair to call men in black unsatisfying , because there's a lot of great stuff in it . it does , however , feel unfinished ; it's great stuff not yet formed into a great movie . more to the point , it functions best as a set-up for -- oh bitter irony -- yet another big-budget summer sequel . only when compared to its current competition is it the summer masterpiece everyone was ready for it to be . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist . ' " 
the price asked by mr . gaunt is always more than reasonable , at least where money is concerned , and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal , so be it . how is it that a film with a good cast , stylish direction and camera work , and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre ? perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question , needful things would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is . what at the outset is the film's strength turns into its greatest liability . unfortunately , once that has happened , the movie doesn't know where to go with the story , so it turns to the old hollywood stand-bys of a pyrotechnics show , a lot of dumb dialogue , and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many . the final scene isn't the problem ; it's the one that immediately precedes it . this is so dumb that i felt like yelling at the screen . the big payoff in needful things is a gyp , and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches . those that sit through this picture deserve more than they're given . it's too bad about the climax , because the bulk of the overly-long film shows promise . there are the usual horror staples , like the meat cleaver in the head and the shock-tactic swell of music , but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind , and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands . max von sydow is an inspired casting choice , and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about needful things . he manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience off-balance . he's the bad guy , all right--there's never any doubt about that--but he's so cultured and smooth , and delivers the one-liners so bitingly , that it's almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him . certainly , it's von sydow's rendering of gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious . ed harris , bonnie bedelia , and amanda plummer have shown great ability in the past , but none of that is evident here . plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature . harris , who's supposed to be playing the heroic lawman , is about as potent as a limp noodle . if he hasn't done so well with three of the four main actors , at least first-time feature director fraser c . heston ( son of charlton ) can boast excellent cinematography ( by tony westman ) and a creepy atmosphere . needful things consistently looks nice , even during its most banal scenes . some of the choppy pacing is clearly heston's fault , but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame . sadly , the same ability is not in evidence here , where doyle reworks his dead again music into an overwrought theme that , at best , does little for the film . there are a couple of effective musical sequences , but neither uses doyle's work , instead relying on " ave maria " and grieg's " in the hall of the mountain king " . needful things is another example of a good idea gone awry . since i'm not a fan of mr . king and can't claim to more than occasionally read his work , it's difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books . whatever the case , in leland gaunt , needful things wastes one of the year's most intriguing villains . this is a case of a film building to an apex that isn't there . by the time the end credits roll , a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything . sadly , the answer is yes , but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of max von sydow . 
it had the energy of a great powerful mahler ( or perhaps shostakovich ) symphony . it was in four parts , and except for the andante 2nd movement , it was one with all of the horns and kettle drums at full force . like mahler there was even the light playful little parts in the heat of show as great and hilarious one liners would send the audience into laughter and then off we were again into another cliff hanger . for those non-musicologists , think of james bond , but a lot more believable . think of the recent movie speed , but give it some heart and give it even better action shots . and you thought your day was hectic . the only flaw in the movie is the slow 2nd part . it works pretty well with the exception of the interrogation scene which has been called cruel by some critics . you can judge for yourself . i did not care for that scene , but did like the other parts of the movement albeit not near as much as the rest of movie . it has some of the best and most realistic stunts in a long time . the script was very creative and imaginative . this scene has great tension and yet is funny at the same time in the movie . there are many scenes where one must suspend disbelief , but in this movie it is extremely easy . you will have to see the movie to find out . if i explained it , you wouldn't understand . if you read the credits you can see how he fired the original 3 screenwriters and then took over the writing job himself and rewrote their script . it is terrific . i found myself clapping many times at some of the action scenes during the show and many times i was laughing out loud . ditto for numerous other members of the audience . the acting is top-notch all around . schwarzenegger is at his best . i was surprised to see tom arnold do an excellent job as the other spy . teenagers i am sure will be cheering loudly for her . tia carrere is a great and gorgeous terrorist helper . it is rated r . schwarzenegger kills tons of people but with fairly minimal blood or gore . i think teenagers will love this movie , but i would not take a child younger than 13 . i recommend true lies most highly . i came very close to rating it * * * * , but in the end i gave it * * * 1/2 because the andante was not on the same par as the rest of the movie . see this film on biggest screen you can find . too bad it is not available on imax . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
this film was adapted from a lucille fletcher 22-minute radio drama , where agnes moorehead played the invalid heiress leona stevenson . the film plays on one's fears of being alone and of being physically handicapped . the film uses the method of flashback to enlarge the story . the film is well executed , mainly through the efforts of the director and the star of the film . even as an intolerable woman , casting herself in self-imprisonment , she engineers our sympathy for her current plight , as we see that she desperately needs psychological treatment more than anything else . 
it's therefore somewhat ironic that in attempting to create this honest , true-to-life portrait , bar girls has resorted to all sorts of traditional formulas and stereotypes . the film takes an assortment of caricatures and throws them together into a comic , melodramatic mix that only occasionally works . hoffman and her co-producer/director , marita giovanni , deserve credit for the sincerity of their approach . there's not a note of condescension in this film . it takes homosexuality seriously without turning sexual preference into a soul-searching routine . there are no sudden sexual identity crises or moments of self-doubt . the problem is that the message is superior to the medium of its delivery . even the gender twist can't invigorate this overused storyline . when one character utters the line " can this get any more predictable ? " , she could be talking about hoffman's script . at least a fair amount of the dialogue is interesting--the characters may be living the cliches , but they're not talking them . it's then that things between them start to get rocky . while the core of bar girls is a reasonably solid , if unspectacular , romantic comedy , the satellite subplots are awful . as far as american-produced lesbian films are concerned , bar girls falls somewhere in between the inept-but-well-intentioned claire of the moon and the playfully entertaining go fish . fresh romantic comedies are difficult to come up with regardless of the protagonists' sexual preferences , so bar girls resorts to safe , tired formulas . the target audience will probably enjoy the result , but , for everyone else , it's hardly worth the effort of going to a theater . 
there is no doubt in my mind that david duchovny can be a movie star . his often under-appreciated work on " the x-files " has demonstrated both dramatic chops and a wry sense of humor , as well as the requisite physicality for action . duchovny has the looks , the smarts and the range on the big screen to go places most fellow tv alums never go . it's also clear that he knows how to pick interesting scripts . to a resume which already includes unconventional fare like kalifornia and the rapture , duchovny adds mark haskell smith's playing god . smith's script does about all you could ask a script to do , delivering some well-developed characters and smart dialogue ( okay , there are a couple of howlers ) in service of that premise . duchovny selected a nice piece of material to work with , but playing god shows that an actor can't choose most of the things which go into the making of a good film . it has the feel of a film which should have been much better , but turned out inconsistent and sloppy under the first-time direction of andy wilson ( of the popular cable mystery series " cracker " ) . there are times when wilson tries so hard to create his gritty thriller atmosphere -- all distorted imagery , slow motion and awkward cross-cutting -- that the narrative begins to get lost . he's going for the right mood , but with the wrong methods . duchovny also had no control over the performances of his cast-mates , though from all appearances , neither did the director . his performance might have been even more effective if a dozen other supporting players weren't making unhinged seem so unnecessary . the general tone of the performances makes duchovny stand out like buster keaton in a three stooges short . his deadpan demeanor begins to seem like a reaction to a bunch of nutcase actors let loose on the screen , rather than the appropriate personality for his redemption-hungry character . in fact , duchovny is too " together " most of the time ; rock bottom doesn't look all that bad if that's where he's supposed to be when we meet him . then again , it's hard to say whether that particular character choice was duchovny's to make . you can see his star quality in playing god , but you can also see that picking a sharp script is no guarantee that an actor will be in a sharply-made film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
starring : willem dafoe , miranda richardson , rosemary harris , tim dutton , nickolas grace director : brian gilbert producers : peter samuelson , marc samuelson , and harvey kass screenplay : michael hastings and adrian hodges based on the play by michael hastings cinematography : martin fuhrer music : debbie wiseman released by miramax films tom and viv is culture . from the opening credits to the closing caption , this is never in doubt . eliot's tragic first marriage has all the marks of a " typical " british art film ( or an extended masterpiece theater episode ) : it's wonderfully acted ( with one exception ) , nicely photographed , dryly scripted , and trudges along with the pace of a slug . both dafoe and richardson have some difficulty giving credible performances when their characters are young . richardson improves greatly as vivienne ages . sadly , the same can't be said for dafoe . nevertheless , despite his obvious distress , tom sticks by his wife although few aspects of their union could be considered anything less than disastrous . tom and viv doesn't try very hard to make an emotional impact . oh , there are moments when some humanity breaks through the production's icy crust , but the film largely chooses to stand on intellectual grounds . eliot , as clinically portrayed by dafoe , comes across as a cold fish -- all mind and no heart . when circumstances at last drive him to bleat , " i crave companionship , yet i am completely alone , " there are few in the audience who will spare him more than an obligatory moment of sympathy . actors such as albert finney and anthony hopkins have created memorable characters out of repressed personalities . the same cannot be said of dafoe . tom is never more than a generic poet , and the internal mechanisms of his greatness remain hidden . whatever emotional response we have is reserved for vivienne--and that's largely the result of miranda richardson's performance ( for which she received an oscar nomination ) . had this film been a little more about viv , with less emphasis on her partner , tom and viv would likely have seemed less stagnant . there are times when the melodrama of tom and viv becomes too much , but the film's most serious flaw is its pacing--it drags , especially during the last half-hour . while there's an admitted fascination in observing the disintegration of a once-promising union , especially with a performance like richardson's in the foreground , tom and viv would have been more moving had the filmmakers done some judicious editing . 
the road home ( wo de fu qin mu qin ) , by acclaimed director zhang yimou ( to live and shanghai triad ) , is an exceedingly modest love story that is saved by its gorgeous filming , haunting scoring and heartfelt acting . although your mind may wander since so little happens , your eyes may tear up during some of the striking visuals . the result is a disappointing film that's still worth seeing . this part is shot in radiant colors , which perfectly capture the rich yellows and golds of an autumn forest . yusheng's mother , di zhao , a petite young beauty , is played with a bright eyed spark by zhang ziyi . the film's pervasive theme music , which repeats every few minutes , could become a sort of chinese water torture if you didn't like it . personally , i didn't care how many dozen times it played , i couldn't get enough of it . a week from now , i suspect that this tune will be the only part of the production that will prove memorable . the film is in mandarin with english subtitles . it is rated g since there is nothing to offend anyone of any age . kids less than 13 , however , are not likely to find much to hold their interest . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the camera theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
some time ago , i wrote that sylvester stallone was a better actor than steven seagal . oddly , stallone , who once shone in rocky , seems to have adopted the non-emotive state in response to the desire of his most ardent fans , who want action , not character . those stallone die-hards should be pleased with their idol's latest , assassins . it effectively fills the above mandate . it's like arnold schwarzenegger essaying an existentialist--laughably absurd . and " absurd " is precisely what a good portion of assassins is . in addition to stallone's inflexible facial expression , the film is saddled with a preposterous script and hideous dialogue . plus , it weighs in at a too- long one-hundred thirty-two minutes . the plot is an excuse for gun fights . rath ( like the audience ) could care less . thus begins one of the great screen romances of the last five minutes . . . the cast is interesting . it's banderas' pecs , however , not his acting , on display here . his bain is a pure caricature--he laughs , sneers , and sweats his way through the part . as for the presence of a solid talent like julianne moore in this living comic book . . . come to think of it , though , even an accomplished actor couldn't do much with this screenplay . the action scenes are competently constructed , and the climactic shootout provides a few moments of tension , but that's scarcely reason to sit through the rest of assassins' drivel . there are plenty of more exciting , reasonably intelligent action films ( including the aforementioned lethal weapons ) available to the adrenaline junkie . of course , with all the gunplay , the body count here goes pretty high , but the biggest casualty of assassins is the viewer who expects to get something remotely original out of this recycled formula with its stony star . 
for moviegoers who think that the problem with today's cinema is its reliance on subtlety and its lack of gore , luc besson ( the fifth element ) has made just the movie for them , the messenger : the story of joan of arc , a movie so over the top that it could become a campy cult classic . in 8mm , joel schumacher was criticized for making a sleazy movie about a search for a snuff film . ( poor dental health is so conspicuously featured in the movie that you half expect a toothpaste product placement . ) to dramatically underscore the point that the english soldiers are like animals , we witness them before the rape pouring stew on the top of the dirty table so they can then eat off of it like dogs . like a bad horror movie , besson has the interior lit by huge flashes of lightning . her performance , which at first seems quite impressive , quickly becomes tediously repetitive . most of the movie consists of confusing battle scenes of hand-to-hand combat . frantically edited to match joan's spastic energy , the scenes are so full of gore that the mpaa should now retire the nc-17 rating . if they can give this movie an r , which they did , then there is no point any longer in pretending that the nc-17 rating even exists . besson shares the writing credits , if not exactly the honors , with andrew birkin , the author of such gems as king david . among the laughably bad lines is one uttered by the conscience ( dustin hoffman no less ) . for the messenger's audience , it is as soon as the ending credits begin to roll . the messenger : the story of joan of arc runs one hundred and forty one long minutes , but who's counting ? it is incorrectly rated r for strong graphic battles , a rape and language . it should be considered nc-17 and would be inappropriate for anyone less than a high school senior . sadly , there was an 8-year-old next to me and other kids even younger in our audience . 
packed with way too many characters , subplots and small talk , the movie is in bad need of major pruning . still , the best parts can be quite intriguing . ( the movie , without benefit of the digital fig leaves in eyes wide shut , explores some of the same issues . here the scenes are much more explicit , and there is significant violence as well , but this film too is rated r . so much for the eyes wide shut rating controversy . as you can guess , ritchie appears prominent on the list . overlaid over the story is a thick score full of melancholy . lee includes video clips and references to the period , like the 1977 blackout , to give the movie a strong sense of time and place . perhaps those filled with new york nostalgia will forgive the film for its meandering pace and loss of focus . people outside of the five boroughs , on the other hand , may feel like breslin . this is a movie to love and hate equally . it is rated r for strong graphic violence and sexuality , pervasive strong language and drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature . 
how she handles the few dramatic moments of her life , right before her high school graduation , is what makes this a very french film . but , i guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder , because he didn't look like a train wreck to me . the beauty in the film is in judith godr ? che portrayal , that gets the most out of the terse dialogue and slim story , as she manages to look alluring in many different poses and who through her vitality and cynicism , always gives off a sense of hope that she will survive , no matter the situation . she fits the lifestyle of the existential hero . . . a female version of a camus hero or a rimbaud protagonist . the film had a very lively pulse which added to its intelligent drama . 
the best of the segments are absolutely mesmerizing , but the worst of them are seat-numbingly tedious . but like most motion pictures , the prop department never stocks umbrellas , a fact which never ceases to amaze me . although the movie has a cast of thousands , the stories are really individual ones . to underscore this , the film's killer score starts with a long and loud rendition of " one is the loneliest number . " in a fascinating performance likely to get an oscar nomination for best supporting actor , tom cruise is frank t . j . mackey , a motivational speaker for sex-crazed men who aren't getting enough . when he demands coffee in one scene , the reaction is that , if ever a man didn't need caffeine , it is frank . generally frank doesn't think much of woman as people , but he does see some value in them . robards , an actor whose talents i find highly limited , gets way too much screen time for my taste . although the film starts with great momentum , anderson loses it all by dragging it out just past three hours . the last hour , especially , is a real snoozer . never even attempting to bring the stories together into a satisfying whole , anderson instead ends the movies with a ridiculous conclusion introduced completely out of left field . magnolia runs way too long at 3 : 02 . it is rated r for strong language , drug use , sexuality and some violence and would be acceptable for older and mature teenagers . 
for those who think that what movies need today are more elaborate gimmicks , time code is the answer , since it is nothing but one long , insufferable gimmick . collectively these 4 movies form one story with the characters moving freely between the sections of the screen . the most exciting parts are when the characters place cell phone calls across quadrants for a little chitchat . the result is the artistic type of experiment that seems designed to put film critics in ecstasy over the movie's showy , avant-garde techniques . the film would seem destined to be played and discussed ad nauseam at college film courses . it should be pointed out that one can achieve almost the same effect any afternoon at your local sears store by turning 4 adjoining television sets on 4 different soap operas . yes , this approach will not permit the interaction between frames , but soap operas are so alike that you can easily imagine that the characters in the various shows are conversing . most viewers , however , will be more likely to point out time code's two fatal flaws . first , none of the stories in time code are worth including in a normal movie . most of the stories will have viewers alternating between wondering what they are about and not caring what the answer is . second , although having multiple screens is undeniably cute , it is just a distraction . sony's new marketing campaign suggests that viewers see the movie four times , watching a different quadrant at each session . since it's only the interaction between the quadrants that make the story the least bit compelling , concentrating on one would be painful . the large , stellar cast improvise their parts based on a written outline . figgis raises the audio level in the quadrant on which he would like us to focus , but even when he tries to get our eyes elsewhere , it's hard to look away as these two actresses in the back of a limo play kissy-face like a pair of love-struck teens . the only completely satisfying part of the production is the music , especially a long , dreamy section of a gustav mahler symphony . closing your eyes enhances the pleasure , but you run the risk of falling asleep . this is also a problem with your eyes open . i would rather have seen that movie than time code . it is rated r for drug use , sexuality , language and a scene of violence and would be acceptable for older teens . 
satoshi kon's perfect blue gives an entirely new meaning to the term " cartoon violence . " featuring multiple realistic rapes , gory stabbings , mutilations , sex and full-frontal nudity , this animated feature from japan hails from the brian de palma school of excess . needless to say , it's not for kids . and i would go further to argue that it's not for most adults either since it's level of writing is beneath them . sadayuki mura's script , which is dubbed into english , might not have been so ridiculous in its native language , but one suspects it was . this style of japanese animation is called " anime , " and perfect blue is the first example of that art form that i can remember seeing . whether this one is typical or not i cannot say , i am only reviewing this particular film and not the genre . although the drawing in perfect blue is colorful , it is as flat and lifeless as a typical saturday morning television cartoon . the action is created mainly by panning the camera across the canvas and making some of the characters' lips move slightly . the resulting two-dimensional look is particularly uninviting . the story is told with the old trick of sequences that look real but which turn out to be fantasies and vice versa . if mima wasn't such a twit , one might have been able to care about her some . there is probably an audience for perfect blue , but i can't figure out what the demographics would be . it's too dumb for adults and too violent for kids . it is not rated but would be an r for strong violence , rape , gore , strong sexuality and nudity . it would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature . 
how else is it possible to explain the countless incarnations of lassie and benji ? really , andre isn't much more than lassie with flippers . some might argue that there's a little more to this film than that , but all of the peripheral stuff is only so much excess baggage . it's developed and presented with little flair and a high degree of obviousness . those seeking hard- hitting drama had best look elsewhere . the closest andre gets to that sort of thing is a couple of smarmy scenes that preach the need for tolerance . the return to health is a slow process , but eventually the seal--named andre by toni--is ready to return to its natural habitat . considering andre as light family entertainment is the only way to form a satisfying opinion of the movie . on a strictly clinical level , it really isn't very good--the cliche-riddled plot is hopelessly predictable , the characters are broadly realized , and the acting is merely serviceable . however , this , much like free willy , is the kind of movie that kids enjoy . the villains are suitably nasty , the heroes are nicely heroic and , of course , the seal is cute and funny . also , andre has a couple of none-too-subtle messages that everyone will understand . she's an appealing performer who shows promise , but she still has some rough edges to file down . when she smiles , she lights up the screen , but her expressions of sadness and grief are less overwhelming . nevertheless , she's considerably more credible than many actors of her age . those with children can feel confident that andre will present an enjoyable ninety-six minutes for their offspring . there's a lot of saccharine here--perhaps too much for the " intellectual " movie-goer . andre will appeal most strongly to the under-thirteen crowd , or at least to those who are of that age in heart , if not in body . 
a solid action thriller directed by alfred hitchcock . but it has many plot flaws and suffers from poor pacing and can best be perceived as a precursor to his much improved other 'framed innocent man pic , ' north by northwest . the film draws to an action conclusion , with barry and fry mixing it up on the statue . the film can be forgiven for its many patriotic speeches extolling the virtues of america , since there was a war taking place . but it can't be forgiven for how shoddy the story line was and how you can just about challenge every scene in this film as being fake . when the nazi ring gets cummings in nyc , there's no way they would handle him so casually , making his escape seem so easy , as they didn't even tie him up . when taken to nyc by baxter , a call would have been placed to kruger exposing cummings , which for some unexplained reason wasn't done . the other major flaw was that cummings and lane were much too bland to give this story personality . hitch's first choices of gary cooper and barbara stanwyck would have made the film that much more charismatic , though cummings and lane were not that bad as much as they were colorless . 
one of the better sci-fi'ers to emerge from the 1950s . the only part of the film that is in color , is the red letters of the title . no money is taken , only sugar . go figure its ants that did this ! so you can't blame sgt . since the girl's father was a f . b . i . agent on vacation , this makes it a federal crime and the f . b . i . it is these constant little touches throughout the film , more so than the special effects , that make this film come to life . this film was intelligently presented , the special effects were effective enough , and the cast , especially edmund gwenn , all provided fine performances , all this adding up to a really decent and subtle film . 
baise-moi ( rape me ) , which has the dubious distinction of being literally banned in france , could be a strikingly effective public service announcement against the dangers of casual sex if it weren't for the fact that manu and nadine like to murder strangers , male and female , indiscriminately even if no sex whatsoever is involved . the reactions to the film are likely to be as widely varied as at our screening in which one guy laughed constantly , apparently seeing the film as a humorous thelma & louise do porn , and another woman remarked to me afterwards that a film like this could ruin sex for you forever . a hyperviolent film which features real , not simulated , sex , it does have its erotic moments , the shocking rape scene not being one of them . " where are the witty lines ? " amen . the film is in french with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be nc-17 for graphic , real sex , graphic violence , drug usage and language . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
so how many really good movies can you name about brother-sister relationships ? and what if you limit your list to only those about adult siblings ? don't be surprised if your list is empty , or at least close to it . in the future , any such list will have to start with you can count on me , the winner for best picture and best screenplay at this year's sundance film festival . written and directed by ken lonergan ( the writer of last year's hit comedy analyze this ) , you can count on me is a rich and witty drama whose centerpiece is a sibling relationship . but this isn't one of those dysfunctional families movies , even if their relationship does have its difficult moments . this is a story of love , not hate . the chemistry between them and between terry and rudy is remarkable and genuine . sammy has had a modestly successful life , but terry is a screw-up , although he claims , as if he doesn't believe it , that " i'm not the kind of guy that everyone says i am . " " what are you talking about , " rudy asks him with soulful , confused eyes . " i have no idea , " terry confesses in a bit of self-reflection . the beauty of the delicate script is the way tragedy is consistently downplayed and that key incidents are merely sketched out . the writer allows us to use our imagination to fill in the details . and the direction is done with great subtly and finesse so that there isn't an overacted or schmaltzy moment in the production . the result is a picture so authentic that it has the audience hitting the ground running . only a few minutes into it , and we feel like we've known and cared about these people all of our lives . linney delivers this line with heart-felt but restrained emotions , making it feel as genuine as if she were talking about her own dead mother . his is an anal-retentive type , who admits that " i like paperwork . " he wants daily time cards and a conservative color palette for the bank's pc displays . besides writing and directing , lonergan also plays the part of sammy's laid back priest , the funniest character in the movie . linney , with some of the spunk that holly hunter demonstrated in broadcast news , delivers a delicately nuanced and wonderfully appealing performance that deserves to be remembered at oscar time . but you want to see this movie now and not wait until the nominations come out to remind you of the great movies that you missed . you can count on me runs 1 : 49 . it is rated r for language , some drug use and a scene of sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . 
anyone who expects historical accuracy from a disney animated feature should be ashamed of themselves . writers binder , grant , and lazebnik have changed those details ( and more ) in an effort to create a story that appeals to both children and adults . taking advantage of the studio's breathtakingly intricate animation , directors mike gabriel and eric goldberg have breathed vitality into this , the fifth " new wave " disney animated feature . this film isn't quite as cute ; deals with some reasonably serious , " adult " issues ; and contains an element of poignancy . considering the less upbeat nature of the story , pocahontas isn't as fun or energetic as its disney predecessors . the plot moves somewhat slowly , disdaining the frantic pace of the lion king . the menken/schwartz musical production numbers are lively ( and probably better than anything since beauty and the beast ) , but their on-screen time represents less than a third of the movie's " action . " while none is presented with any special subtlety ( after all , children are supposed to get the message ) , there is surprisingly little preaching . it would have been easy to turn this into a " native american good/white man bad " film , but positive and negative traits are shown on both sides . the governor will not go down in history as one of the great disney villains . he's more of a loud-mouthed boor than anything else -- not an evil-to-the-bone nasty like jaffar or ursula . children everywhere will flock to see it , accompanied by adults who rightfully recognize disney animated films as solid entertainment for the over-ten crowd . the only question about this movie is whether , without the " happily-ever-after " ending , it will attract the repeat business of aladdin and the lion king . 
" i'm ovulating ! besides being tyrannical , " middle-aged " hallie is quite cynical , since she says she " is about 35 " -- 32 to be exact . you can immediately tell the other couple is bad since zack smokes like a chimney and they don't recycle . all four of the actors in the purposely-claustrophobic tale are well cast . the two female characters are nicely contrasted . what happens next is obvious even if the reactions aren't . " i can't believe you can do this to me , robert , " she yells quite naturally , but then throws in a zinger , which reveals her true feelings . " i'll be ovulating in a few days now . " hallie always knows what is most important to her , and it isn't robert . >from this long setup , the body of the movie takes several twists , some surprising and some predictable , but all quite satisfying . the sophistication of the production belies its modest budget . shot in a house in an 18-day shoot , it still backs the wallop of a movie with much bigger stars and budget . most reviews end with the critic telling you what the movie is about . this time let me quote from the writer and director who summarizes it well . " the movie is about personal responsibility , " reiss said . robert lets himself be drawn into a hellish web , and it is his responsibility and no one else's . ( reiss also explained the film's goofy title , which makes little sense and still doesn't after you've heard his rationale . it is not rated but would be an r for sex , profanity , and violence and would be fine for older teenagers . 
this crushes agba's heart because he loves the horse so . on board the ship , disaster strikes , as it always does on board ships in stories like this . once in france , the horses are not very welcomed . although they should be prime racing horses , the french find them inferior because they are afterall , smaller than normal . only sham is saved so that he can do menial chores pulling a wagon . from there , you can write the rest of the story yourself . pretty much what you think will happen does . nevertheless , the film is about agba and navin chowdhry gives a miserable and lifeless performance as agba . this is a movie that tries first and foremost to be wholesome . it succeeds . on the other hand , as compelling entertainment , it does not deliver . even my amiable son jeffrey ( age 7 ) , who tends to like every single movie he sees , found it kind of boring . if you want to see a great story about horses , try black beauty ( 1994 ) . it is rated pg , but it is really more a g film . i am not quite sure why it got the pg rating . it would be fine for any kid , but i suspect the slow pace and the lack of an involving story may lose the attention of most children . i can not recommend this show whose only claims to fame are that it is about horses and that it is for whole family . i give it * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
for those of you who thought neil labute's latest cinematic diatribe , your friends & neighbors , was too upbeat , happiness is just the film for you . writer and director todd solondz , who burst onto the motion picture landscape a couple of years ago with the widely acclaimed welcome to the dollhouse , is back with his second film , happiness , which is about people who are anything but . ( for the record , i had solondz's first picture at the absolute top of my best of the year list in 1996 . it was the best example in years of what an indie film could be . it had unknown actors in a low budget production that had more insights and depth than ten normal films . the actors in it have not had much subsequent success , but , since the movie's brilliance stemmed mainly from the director's creative energies , solondz's second film has been much anticipated . ) " it's you . " and joy is the nicest character in the movie . andy comes unglued with this brutal display of honesty . critics see such a wide variety of films that we become fairly thick skinned , but this film managed to create major feelings of revulsion in me . happiness , a probable winner in the " downer movie of the decade " category , tries hard to shock its audience and succeeds . unlike his mesmerizing first endeavor , solondz's second film offers few insights , contenting itself with operating solely on the surface level . like a facade on a movie set , if you look beneath the glossy surface and the talented cast , there's not much there . the relentless happy music may lure some into snickering , which would be rather akin to laughing during a funeral . philip seymour hoffman plays a flabby , obscene caller named allen , who is almost incapable of even conversing with a female . well , there are a few flaws in their domestic bliss . besides the excellent acting , there are many things to admire in happiness . films can be hard to take and yet extremely rewarding -- in the company of men , for example . it is fine for films to be hard to stomach if the payoff is there , but happiness provides none . it pushes the envelope of decency only to see how far it can go , like some child pushing the limits to see how much he can get away with . leaving the theater , your reaction is liable to be complete disgust as if you have been violated in some insidious way . happiness is such a gut wrenching experience that they should give out " i survived happiness ! " t-shirts in the lobby afterwards . happiness runs needlessly long at 2 : 14 as if solondz wants to prolong the agony . the film isn't rated but would be nc-17 for suicide , murder , rape , masturbation , violence , sex , profanity , pedophilia , etc . the film is for adults only . 
screenplay : w . peter iliff . director : mike robbins . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 103 minutes . it would also be inaccurate -- religious faithful generally demonstrate some sense of proportion . a cult would be more analagous , with thousands of people connecting their happiness to the achievements of mere mortals to whom greater powers are ascribed . or perhaps rudimentary tribal warfare is more appropriate . or even basic psychological child abuse . or , varsity blues could be made . as the exceedingly pleasant van der beek plays him , there's never much question at all . he's a broad strokes hero like kilmer -- who's not only a martinet , but a racist just for good measure -- is a broad strokes villain . dramatically , mox is a flatline . that inconsequential plot progression wastes plenty of potentially compelling conflict . the emotional center of varsity blues should have been the pressure and twisted values that make high school kids believe nothing they ever do will be as valuable , a sentiment expressed in kilmer's pep talk that the big game is " 48 minutes for the next 48 years of your lives . " though director brian robbins ( making a dramatic leap from good burger ) nails the atmosphere of abandoned friday night streets , w . peter iliff's script uses it mostly as scenery for a typical teen soap opera . it's worth noting that robbins and ilif include at least a few insightful scenes -- including one player's rage against how much he's always hated the game -- between the obligatory t&a and party-hearty scenes . this isn't the last picture show we're talking about , nor was it ever likely to be , but it could have aimed for something slightly more ambitious than a climax where all that matters is whether the coyotes can win the big game . that's not just uninspired -- given the setting , it's painfully ironic . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : randall wallace , based on the novel by alexandre dumas . producers : randall wallace and russell smith . director : randall wallace . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 124 minutes . it is the moment most of the audience -- the non-teenage-female , dicaprio-swooning portion -- has been waiting for . it is a moment guaranteed to inspire pseudo-spontaneous applause and whoops of approval . . . assuming the audience hasn't drifted into a heavy slumber . for around 100 minutes , randall wallace's rendition of the man in the iron mask wanders through attractive sets in search of a consistent tone , thematic coherence or even a real point . is it a lavish , lusty period romp in the spirit of richard lester's 1970s musketeers films ? is it a moody dickensian pot-boiler of a mysterious parentage and uncertain motivations ? is it a showcase for tiger beat poster-boy-du-jour dicaprio ? wallace effectively combined vengeance , romance and adventure in his script for braveheart , but in his first film behind the camera he never seems clear how to unite all the elements he introduces . the man in the iron mask sputters and hesitates like the work of a nervous rookie who just keeps throwing stuff at the screen in the vain hope that , eventually , something's gotta stick . the uninvolving and ponderous first hour and a half leaves a viewer plenty of time to scratch at minor annoyances until they become major annoyances . meticulously smudged rabble rouse themselves for a minor riot for exactly one scene , perhaps to distract momentarily from the impression that this is an epic with a cast of tens . half the cast speaks with french accents ( all genuine , courtesy depardieu , anne parillaud and plasticine ingenue judith godreche ) , while the other half appears to have wandered in from malibu , or london , or dublin . given the chance to bite into louis xiv's nastiness with relish , dicaprio instead gives him a tiresome method twist which suggests he just wants to be loved . all might have been forgiven if only wallace had played the musketeer trump card for all it was worth . he's got viewers right where he wants them with such iconic characters at his disposal ; the good will is as palpable as it is at a james bond film , where the mere utterance of a trademark phrase generates a ripple of excitement . there's just no good excuse to waste that kind of good will on one or two rounds of lackluster swordplay . dumas wrote wonderful pulp ; wallace tries to turn that pulp into something it's not , only he's not exactly sure what that is . the man in the iron mask is a big muddled mess of an adventure yarn , satisfying only for those interested in going to watch dicaprio in regal finery looking his prettiest . others will find a waste of stellar cast and classic story which never gets a handle on what the film should have been about for the average viewer : a chance to cheer for the crossed swords of re-born legends just a bit earlier than 100 minutes after the lights go down . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
a 1940s-style melodrama but with color . the movie unfolds like a dream with model-quality characters slowly drifting through the sumptuous sets . as directed by philip haas and scripted and edited by his wife belinda , who worked together on angels and insects , the movie induces an almost trance-like state in the audience . containing a small drama wrapped in a light-weight romance , the story moves on gossamer wings , never boring and yet never quite compelling . a lovely , moving tableaux , it's almost sad the way the picture never quite obtains lift-off . the princess says that her husband is " ugly enough to frighten the horses , " but that's not a problem since he has given her wealth and freedom . the biggest problem with the screenplay is that it makes rowley into a lovable pussycat . scott thomas and penn do everything asked of them , but it just isn't quite enough to make this quaint little story into much of a movie . still , if you're in need of some tranquility and rest , you could do worse than park your weary bones in a theater that's playing up at the villa . and , if you do nod off every now and then , not to worry -- you won't miss anything important . you'll leave the theater feeling rested and peaceful , not something that can be said about the effect of most movies . it is rated pg-13 for some sexuality and violence and would be acceptable for those 11 and up . there is , however , little to hold the interest of most kids . 
their earnest , well-crafted stories of folks caught up in the turbulence of political violence have moved many viewers to heap adjectives of praise upon their films . and while all this occurs , i find myself sitting and thinking , " you know , it was good , but . . . " sheridan and george's latest collaboration , the boxer , falls into a very similar category . there are always plenty of things to like about a sheridan film , most notably his ability to create a vibrant sense of place . the divided belfast of the boxer is a startling image , with its physical wall dividing the people even more concretely than the differing ideologies . the insanity and self-perpetuating violence of the irish conflict are starkly portrayed , with more ambiguity surrounding the question of right and wrong than most films on the subject -- including sheridan and george's own previous films -- have managed to explore . for all its welcome complexity of theme , however , the boxer tends to drift in the exploration of its main characters . nowhere is this more evident than in the love story between danny and maggie , a star-crossed romance which feels more obligatory than well-developed . furtive glances and snatches of conversation establish tension between them , but their connection is never entirely convincing . in one sense , it's an effective device which turns him into an abstract rallying point for the ira rather than an individual human being . none of which is to suggest that the performances aren't strong from top to bottom , because they are . daniel day-lewis brings a resigned dignity to danny ; his unwillingness to return to the ira's ways seems as much a result of fatigue than moral scruple . their stories always hold your attention , but they never engross the way great film stories do . perhaps my sense in the boxer , and with in the name of the father and some mother's son for that matter , is that sheridan and george are more interested in making a point than making a movie . the result is a cerebral film with too little gut-level emotion . sheridan and george are good film-makers , but they could be great if they were as attentive to their people as to their politics . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : jack bernstein , tom shadyac & jim carrey . director : tom shadyac . as many individual elements as i might analyze with any given film , my gut reaction almost always comes down to one crucial issue : did the film do what it was trying to do ? if it was a thriller , did it keep me in suspense ? if it was a romance , did i respond emotionally ? and if it was a comedy , did i laugh ? of all the film types , comedy is perhaps the most difficult to analyze ; either it works , or it doesn't . which brings me to this confession : i laughed at ace ventura : pet detective . god help me , i laughed quite a bit . comedian jim carrey's unique persona won me over in spite of a great deal of stupidity and some sluggish pacing . vanity projects are a dime a dozen these days , but they all apply a very similar logic , namely that if you let the star do what he or she does best , and if that star's audience is large enough , you'll have a success . i'm not sure whether the latter condition is true of carrey , but it is true that he's allowed to do what he does best . it has been a long time since i've seen a physical comedian who looks as comfortable on screen as carrey . his elastic features recall early jerry lewis , while his spindly frame and geeky self- confidence show traces of pee-wee herman . when the comedy is purely physical , the laughs are really big . the opening sequence features ace disguised as a parcel deliveryman gleefully shattering the contents of his package to simulate a shipping mishap . ace ventura boasts some of the most amusing slapstick in recent years this side of the zucker-abrahams-zucker films . it's considerably more erratic in its success when it comes to verbal gags . in fact , ace ventura is almost self-congratulatory in its political incorrectness , using homophobia and sexism as punch lines . the film drags between visual set pieces , rescued only by carrey's goofy delivery . part of the problem is that screenwriters carrey , tom shadyac and jack bernstein frequently seem unclear as to when enough is enough . ace's trademark mocking cackle , borrowed from carrey's fire marshall bill character from " in living color , " is funny once but not three times . a more telling example involves the theme song from the crying game , used perfectly once but then used again so that it just seems derivative . finally , one piece of advice for filmmakers : if you must use dan marino for a cameo , please don't give him too many lines . an isotoner glove commercial is about all i can take . there would seem to be little point to commenting on the supporting players in ace ventura , since for all practical purposes they serve as scenery with sag cards . she has a fun , over-the-top part much like her role in fatal instinct , but wisely she avoids trying to steal scenes from carrey . it just wouldn't work . in ace ventura , jim carrey establishes himself as a first-rate screen clown , one i hope to see again . 
screenplay : andrei kourkov . producers : pierre rival , mykola machenko . director : vyacheslav krishtofovich . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 107 minutes . this might seem like the premise for a slapstick farce ; in fact , it might sound strangely similar to the premise for warren beatty's current bulworth . but like bulworth , a friend of the deceased takes that premise and steers it into some astute social commentary . director vyacheslav krishtofovich and screenwriter andrei kourkov may romanticize the communist past , but they also paint an intriguing picture of people adapting to the capitalist present . a friend of the deceased might have been an even more compelling film if it had been more consistent , both in tone and pacing . at times it takes on the tense atmosphere of an espionage thriller ; at other times , it has the loping pace of deadpan comedy ; at still other times , there is the stark sincerity of domestic drama . each is effective in its own way , but in combination they can leave you wondering how you're supposed to feel about the strange events in anatoly's life . fortunately , that confusion plays a significant role in this story of complex social change where the rules are still being determined . it is also fortunate that alexandre lazarev , with his soulful eyes and weary decency , makes for such a sympathetic tour guide through this world . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
if human conditions were patentable , thomas hardy would have the original patent for hopelessness . as woody allen said , " more than any other time in history , mankind faces a crossroads . hardy novels are like that . although you don't read them to have a good time per se , you do gain a greater understanding of life and of your fellow man . the few hardy novels made into films for theatrical release , tess ( 1979 ) and far from the madding crowd ( 1967 ) , have been excellent , and this year's jude joins that elite list . director michael winterbottom with the help of screenwriter hossein amini makes a literal adaptation of hardy's " jude the obscure . " yes , the shocking parts are there , but they are not sensationalized , and the film is so realistic that had i not known the story and it was presented as a true story , i would not have questioned its veracity . usually the press kits you get at the screenings are fairly honest , but this one did have a whopper of a claim . as one of my fellow critics pointed out to me , it says that winterbottom's previous film butterfly kiss was " a tender and touching love story . " butterfly kiss is a story of a vicious serial killer and although i recommended it , it is anything but tender . nevertheless , i am even more impressed by winterbottom's talents after viewing jude . it is his direction that makes the film . the acting is good , but not on par with the direction . actually , a cogent argument could be made that the real genius is in the photography , but more on that latter . the show opens in the 1860s in a muddy hamlet filmed in black and white reflecting its bleakness . his love life is not much better . although it is completely authentic , it serves as a metaphor for the desperation jude feels . it may also give rise to an increase in vegetarianism as it is candid and gory . the dialog is terrific . amini has a deft touch knowing how to adapt the novel for the screen . where this scene leads is quite unpredictable , but not the result - more grief for both of them . needless to say he views this as extremely cruel . in scene after scene , the audience has to be in awe of the beauty of the cinematography by eduardo serra . i lost track of the number of phenomenally gorgeous images . among my favorites are the one of the snow that looks like cumulous clouds that is lit by the early light of day . all of the interior scenes lit with gaslights have a wonderful warmth . i certainly hope and expect to see an academy award nomination for serra's work here . from the simple pleasures of a faire to basic rustic row houses , it feels totally authentic without ever being overdone . adrian johnston's lovely music is full of haunting flutes and of the sad strains of a wailing violin . people should always stay through the credits . in this show you will learn than mel gibson had a part . perhaps it is not the same person . for those who do not remember the novel be forewarned that this beautiful but consistently morose tale reaches a surprisingly and horrible conclusion . it is one that is consistent with the characters and is genuine , nevertheless , if it doesn't put you in tears , i'd be surprised . it is rated r . there is sex , full frontal female nudity , graphic depiction of birth , death , and animal slaughter , but no bad language . i am usually conservative when i say which age group a show is appropriate for , but i am going to go out on a limb on this one . i think it would be okay for most teenagers since they would learn from it . i have a single test for parents . if you would let your kids read the book , then this movie should be okay . yes , life is frighteningly depicted , but it is always realistic and never sensationalized . jude gets a strong recommendation from me , and i award it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

" pre-echoes of blue abound in this film . adding to the similarities , zbigniew preisner's=20 haunting score for no end can be heard often during blue as a=20 composition by " van den budenmayer " . however , while ulla's story is no=20 end's most powerful element , the emotional impact here is less than what=20 kieslowski achieved with the first installment of his three colors=20 trilogy . from a purely intellectual perspective , dariusz's story is probably=20 the most intriguing . =20 kieslowski carefully balances both sides of the predicament , presenting=20 them to the audience almost as if asking us to render a verdict . in the=20 end , dariusz' decision is perhaps inevitable , but it gives him no joy . =20 kieslowski uses this sort of ethical and/or moral dilemma frequently in=20 his movies . the metaphysical element of no end , while intriguing in concept , =20 doesn't work all that well on screen . we never get much sense for what=20 antoni's ghost is feeling . he's only in four scenes , and remains=20 something of an enigma -- an impotent watcher who occasionally attempts=20 to communicate with the living by leaving unexpected signs . kieslowski=20 uses antoni's ghost as a metaphor for the average person constrained by=20 martial law -- possessing a clear conscience yet unable to do anything=20 to affect change . the three motifs of no end frequently cross and occasionally=20 entwine . kieslowski doesn't always handle these interconnections well ; =20 in fact , there are times when the different stories mesh clumsily . =20 nevertheless , the film is so packed with ideas that there's never any=20 shortage of material worth pondering , and ulla's emotional torment=20 touches the heart . even though elements of the whole don't blend=20 seamlessly , no end still leaves a lasting impression . looking back on=20 the full body of kieslowski's films , no end can be viewed as an=20 important entry , because , despite its flaws , we can observe embryonic=20 forms of several themes that the director explored more fully in=20 decalogue and three colors . thus , no end functions both as a compliment=20 and a precursor to the director's most lasting works . 
the mystical theme of evil was never fully developed , but the film was well photographed and acted , and the story was very creepy . there were many odd touches that worked very well , that director freddie francis added to this original screenplay by jonathan rumbold & peter spenceley . there's also a surprise ending that fits in well with the film's theme of man's inhumanity . it makes for an above-average horror flick , one that horror fans in particular might enjoy more than others . 
screenplay : ronald bass and al franken . director : luis mandoki . this is the contradiction of when a man loves a woman : as impressed as i was with most of its parts , i kept coming up with better ways to piece them together . it's that rare film that pulls very few punches in its examination of a family in crisis , but there is a schizophrenia in the perspective . there are some extremely effective performances , but director luis mandoki shows us far too much from the perspective of the alcoholic character . but that might be even harder than it first appears , as the lack of social lubricant exposes cracks in michael and alice's relationship , and the time comes for hard decisions . he doesn't respect alice , and a couple of great scenes demonstrate how he treats her like one of his children . ryan is solid as the fragile and frightened alice , and plays a very restrained drunk . she also makes a believable transition after her detox , leading into a fine bit of acting in a counseling session . the big showdown between michael and alice is completely raw and very compelling , and garcia and ryan have tremendous chemistry . i felt this was essentially the story of the family's response to and discovery of the extent of alice's problem , and not the story of alice and her recovery . consequently , i wasn't bothered by the slickness of the production , because it fit with michael's lack of awareness of what was going on beneath the surface . but then mandoki and screenwriters ronald bass and al franken seem to want it both ways , showing us alice sneaking into the street for a drink , or in the middle of a case of the dt's . a focus on michael would have mad this a very different film from most films about substance abuse , but when a man loves a woman retreats into the obvious . it was moments like her last scene with garcia which finally brought me to tears , and convinced me that there should have been more family moments . the original title of when a man loves a woman was significant other , but it really should have been significant others . 
moreau boldly announces that it is a movie not to be ignored . not since seven have i seen such impressive opening credits . that the movie turned out to be as much a religious allegory as an h . g . wells science fiction story , i would have never guessed . i asked several of the other critics after the press screening if they knew if the book had the religious aspects in it , but having not read the book in years , none of them had any idea . personally , i have no problem enjoying stories that are very loose adaptations of books , but still i wondered . i love wells , and this is the first book of his to be made into a movie in twenty years , the last being empire of the ants . you may remember british actor thewlis from his many recent roles including dragonheart , restoration , and black beauty , which is still his best . he is one handsome guy in this getup , but i still do not know why norma moriceau chose this costume for kilmer . even stranger , but somewhat more appropriate is the all white outfit and gloves along with the white pancake makeup that marlon brando wears as dr . moreau . got so bad you couldn't cut a rat without reading him his rights . " he taunts douglas with , " what are you going to say , 'mayday . i'm being held by a pig lady . ' " i vacillated between being absolutely fascinated by this story and wanting the animals to eat brando and kilmer because their acting is so bad . given all of the drugs used and give the look of the cast , another title for the film could have been planet of the apes gets stoned . notice too that the doctor is clearly playing the role of the pope . the script by walon green , michael herr , ron hutchinson , and richard stanley is quite involving . if you like , or at least can ignore , the heavy religious overtones , the script is quite good . it drags some in the middle but it starts and ends strong . director frankenheimer and editor paul rubell know how to craft a high energy presentation that most of the time keeps you on the edge of your seat . moreau would have been much better , but i liked it , flaws and all . the tacked on epilogue message is a lame attempt to justify the religious aspects of the film . they need no justification . you can like them or not , but the epilogue adds nothing and is trite . moreau runs a little over an hour and a half . they did not have a information package available at the screening so i am at a lost for some of the details . the film is rated pg-13 . there is no sex or nudity . the language is mild and the deaths are not very graphic . it would be fine for most kids over say eight . i recommend the picture to you and give * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
the commercials for my life make a big deal out of this as being " from the creators of ghost , " and for good reason . much of the same heartwrenching , occasionally cloying , sentiment is present here . those who hate tear-jerkers should resolutely avoid this film ; my life will leave that crowd retching in the aisles . actually , when the film tunes down the manipulation , it has some genuinely moving and emotionally honest moments . ironically , the most " real " scenes are those of bob videotaping himself . his confessions , reflections , and comments seem far more genuine than any of the numerous melodramatic scenes that have bob actively confronting the realities of life and death . my life lays it on thick in the drawn-out final fifteen minutes , and this hamstrings the project somewhat ( you could hear a lot of nose-blowing in the darkened confines of the theater ) . not that this is a surprise ; fifteen minutes into the movie , it's pretty obvious how it's going to end . overall , the scenes that work outnumber those that fail , and that's reason enough for a die-hard cynic like myself to admit grudgingly to having liked my life . there's enough intelligent stuff contained herein to keep most viewers from dwelling on the maudlin shortcomings . this is no untamed heart , with an impossible-to-accept premise and cringingly bad overacting ; my life may have obvious intentions , but at least it's skillful in presenting them . michael keaton does a fine job as bob jones , and it may be the quality of his performance that makes much of my life work . certainly , even his most ridiculous scenes ( such as where he storms into his doctor's office and informs him : " you can't take away my hope ! it's all i have left ! " ) aren't too painful to sit through . coupled with finely-acted moments when it's possible to feel gail's grief , there are times when ms . kidman doesn't bring enough substance to her character . this may be as much ( or more ) the fault of the writing as that of the actress , though , since it's hard to be consistently sincere uttering the occasional dumb line . haing s . ngor is so good that the scenes featuring chinese mysticism seem less foolish than they might otherwise . it's difficult to predict how tear-jerkers will perform at the box office since this , more than any other class of motion picture , brings out the public's fickle nature . my life isn't a russian tragedy , so there's exhilaration amidst the heartbreak , and the gallows humor manages to avoid being tasteless . those who go to this film expecting to like it probably will , and those who don't , won't . my life is good schmaltz--decent entertainment that has no qualms about mucking around with the audience's emotions ( thus making it a prime " date movie " ) . in addition to being far too blatant about its motives and having a plot that offers almost no surprises , the movie suffers from an unfortunate case of " cuteness " . stone-hearted movie-goers beware--many of you will loathe this film , and those that don't will probably have a hard time justifying how you could actually like it . 
are you thinking about getting a camcorder ? do you already own a camcorder ? if you answered yes to either of these questions , then you must see deception . you will pay for the price of the admission many times over in just a single year by avoiding wasting tons of video tape . the cinematography ( laszlo kovacs ) in deception contains in just over an hour and a half all possible bad camera techniques . by the sixth time you watch the underbelly of a jet roaring overhead or a close-up of silverware shaking in the sink as a jet flies by , you will be busy taking mental notes of what to avoid . you also get lots and lots of pans - many of them blurry to keep your viewers curiosity going . you will find how you can make your audience laugh during serious shots like the climbing a gigantic pyramid at dawn by using silly camera angles . oh yes , the movie itself ? it is a mess . you say you want to know the plot . well , this much i will tell you . if you like andie macdowell like i do , then you do get to see her in almost every scene . if you like the costar , liam neeson , forget it , he hardly ever appears . deception's silly plot is unimportant to you , of course , since you are seeing this film in order to save on tape purchases . truth be told , the plot is so crazy and so full of holes that it keeps your attention in a strange sort of way . it is so bad , it is fascinating . it is rated pg-13 for some violence and bad language , but on the whole it is a pretty tame show . i give it a very generous * for somehow keeping my attention by being so ridiculous i kept wondering what would happen next . non-camcorder owners should avoid this show . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : december 13 , 1993 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
rivette has created a work of art from a short balzac story about art , " the unfinished masterpiece . " it is just something she does so she could be independent of nicolas . la belle noiseuse , which we are told , is the title of the masterpiece , is about a 17th century lady of the world who was kind of nutty in the sense that she was difficult to figure out , who is referred to as being someone who is a " ball-buster . " what makes for a captivating depiction of an artist at work , are scenes such as these , where one's sense of time is lost , and the length of the picture , ( it is 240 minutes ) does not seem wasted even for a minute , as we watch and become part of the creation , starting from scratch , and actually are hearing the artist's scratching sounds on the canvas for minutes at a time with no action on the screen but to view him work and watch him manipulate the model into the pose he wants , even when she complains that he is hurting her . frenhofer is stuck . he is filled with self-doubt if he can ever paint again . marianne asks him , " why " me " naked in front of you , why not liz " ? she goes on to say , " i need to understand this " . . . it seems the situation has reached a point of no return . every character is now playing out his emotional trump cards . there is a hint of a possible affair that might have taken place between balthazar and her ten- years ago , that seems to be the cause of the tension we feel among the three of them . liz says , " for freno , it is the art of it , it is the capturing of a whole life in a painting--- it is that thing that makes art shameless , that is what matters to him . it is as if one can see one's whole life passing in a flash , like it might be for a person drowning . " so the camaraderie between the two artists seems to be genuinely plausible , in the sense , that they do understand each other , that is , as far as their work goes . with freno , in the position of control in his life , he is able to patronizingly say to nicolas as he departs , " i like you , don't ever change . " the last shot is with the agent , talking numbers with frenhofer , deciding how much they will get for the masterpiece . the acting is exceptionally good by everyone . piccoli as the artist is mesmerizing , while emmanuelle is both beautiful and intelligent , offering a special quality about her that makes it possible for us to believe that a masterpiece could come out of her poses . the only thing that struck me as odd , is that the final masterpiece drawn , supposedly by bernard dufour , did not appear to me to be a masterpiece , but a rather ordinary work . the picture itself is the masterpiece ; that is , the creative process itself , was convincingly done , by a director who has the skills and knowledge to tell such a story and never allow the story to be wavering from its lofty position of significance , as anything but an honest intellectual effort , a search for the truth within . 
can a film be saved by its music ? this is the question that i was pondering during the press screening for the plodding adaptation of the non-fiction book " hemingway in love and war : the lost diary of agnes von kurowsky . " outdoor scenes have majestic sounds full of horns and worthy of a vast symphony . in interior scenes we are treated to intimate violin serenades . every scene is filled with intense musical emotion . ah , but then there are those actors . maybe they should have heard the score during the shooting . perhaps the most charitable thing that can be said of the two leads is that they were miscast . certainly the performances they deliver are so insubstantial that they almost vanish upon closer examination . the love story between them is convincing in spurts , but , for the most part , the chemistry does not work . even less effective , and never believable is agnes's romance with the italian doctor domenico caracciolo ( emilio bonucci ) . much is made of their age difference , he being 19 and she being all of 26 , but they look about the same age in the movie so that is one of many aspects of the picture that were never believable . " you know what i've been told ? " remarks agnes in one of the first scenes . " it won't work , " hemingway argues . the cinematography by roger pratt is handsome and warm , but the picture is content to be little more than pleasant . it is never involving . since i did not care about the characters , i resented some of the manipulative parts of the story . agnes and ernest then rig it so that jimmy wins . the love story between agnes and ernest is more hinted at than shown . i like love affairs that are believable and not ethereal . they do not have to be at all explicit to be great , see , for example , the age of innocence , but they must have enough emotional involvement to be convincing . any time you get this many people involved it is a recipe for disaster . perhaps this is the reason the story skims the surface and never invites you to go deeper . next to the miscasting of the leads , the script is the second biggest problem with the film . then there are the endings . for a while i thought the film was never going to end and that it was a special test version to see how long a dozen film critics would sit there in a dark room watching ending after ending before they gave up and left . we all stayed through the four , but a couple more and i might have been tempted to leave . at least toward the end , we do have a cheery note . i'll keep an eye on my watch waiting for that blessed event . " i love you , " says agnes to ernest . " i'll love you as long as i live . " i wanted and expected to feel that way about this film , but i could not . to answer the question i asked in the beginning , perhaps some films can be saved by the music , but not this one . it is rated pg-13 for war wounds and for sexual situations , but no sex or nudity . i do not remember any profanity , but there probably was a little . the film would be fine for kids say ten and up . it is a close call , but i find the film too mediocre to recommend . i give it * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 20 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
now this is an indie cult film , if ever there was one . they sell both bibles and guns , two contrasting products that fit very well into the mainstream of american society , makes for a most interesting commentary on the american landscape , as directed and written by the south african , daniel j . harris . this b/w , gritty film , is so well-paced and flies by so quickly , that you feel you know these men in the short time span you meet them and you don't want the film to end before you find out just what happens to them , as things begin to turn sour for them . this unique film , in the style of the maysles brother's the salesmen , packs a wallop and a sales pitch that goes beyond the ordinary pseudo-documentary and improvisational work . the theme of the film is really geared for the 1960s in psychology , in the music played and in the dress and style of the salesmen . but were're in the '90s all right and that only adds weight to the idea that these men are really dead already but they just don't know it . these very repulsive reactionary types are so-well caught on camera , as they go from reading the script to ad libbing without missing a beat , in fact the unrehearsed scenes have a special flair about them that is macabre . one of the really powerful scenes , is the opening one when they are selling the collectors' edition bible set and a defender 500 pump-action shotgun in a trailer , it is almost unnerving that they keep a straight face when they say to the poor whites they are selling this to , " the american family deserves to be well-armed and well-read . " the director seems to imply , isn't that what america is about , anyway . they sold me on this film . these " stars " certainly bring a level of authenticity to the film that is uniquely satifsying . this , suprisingly enough , is a not to be missed film , if you can ever locate it on cable . 
mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence , brief nudity ) running time : 140 minutes . early though it may be to make such a prediction , i'm going to do so : no one will be more deserving of an adapted screenplay oscar in 1997 than brian helgeland and curtis hanson . james ellroy's 1990 novel " l . a . confidential " was 496 pages of sprawling , tangled plotting and a staccato prose style in which entire chapters seemed to fly by without a single verb rearing its active little head . even the author himself said he didn't always know what was going on at any given time . hanson and helgeland took that narrative and tamed it into an intricate but accessible crime drama . they remained true to both the style and gritty substance of the story while giving it the appeal of pop entertainment . which is not to say that they have created an unqualified triumph . l . a . confidential is the kind of sturdy , satisfying studio vehicle which turns up rarely enough that it's easy to mistake it for a minor masterpiece . it's well-crafted but never dazzling , consistently interesting without being engrossing . helgeland and hanson haven't exactly taken an unfilmable novel and turned it into a classic . they've taken a novel which would have been a three hour art film and made a 140-minute mainstream multiplex success . there's more than a whiff of chinatown to l . a . confidential -- it's hard not to break into a chuckle when one character appears with a jake gittes memorial nose bandage -- but the story manages to stake out its own unique territory in exposing the dark side of booming post-war los angeles . it does a particularly impressive job of hooking into the relationship between high-profile crime and the media , skewering the public's inexhaustible appetite for sordid tales about which they can feel morally superior . curtis hanson's direction manages to navigate a smart path between the glossy image of hollywood and the sleazy reality . it's a perfectly appropriate ambiguity that l . a . confidential ( photographed by the talented dante spinotti ) may be one of the best-looking films ever made about ugly doings . it's also appropriate that the characters are similarly ambiguous , complex people whose motivations are never as pure or as selfish as they appear at first glance . another of the accomplishments in this fine script is that those characters feel softer and more humanized than they do in ellroy's novel , easier to sympathize with . yet one of the problems with l . a . confidential is that while the characters are uniformly well-acted and multi-dimensional , there's not enough time to get under the skin of any one character . we find ourselves surprised by some of the decisions the characters make , but once we understand a single basic motivation for each one there's not much left to learn about them . pearce , crowe and spacey do solid work with solid characters . they're never boring , and never fascinating . hanson and helgeland still do an impressive enough job that i couldn't help wishing they had trusted their own skill with material a bit more . the plot twists of l . a . confidential may be a lot to take in , but not so much that they require the constant nudging the script and direction provide . every character is identified in bold letters ( sometimes literally ) , every significant development is accompanied by a flashback or wordy exposition to make sure we realize the significance , and whole chunks of the film are summarized at various points like chapter-ending cliff's notes . it all gives a smart film the feeling that it's not quite so smart after all , or that the audience isn't expected to be smart enough to figure it all out . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : sonke wortmann . director : sonke wortmann . of all the things i might claim to understand about movies , i suspect that what makes a given film popular with american audiences will never be one of them . with that in mind , what makes a film popular with non-american audiences ranks somewhere with " what is the sound of one hand clapping " on my personal scale of philosophical inscrutability . many is the film which has come to these shores trumpeted as " one of the most popular films ever in ( fill-in-native-country ) , and it seems that for every once were warriors ( a record-breaker in new zealand ) there is a the mystery of rampo ( last year's japanese smash which turned out to be a bit of psychedelic soft-core porn ) . not ( " die bewegte mann " in europe ) , a silly and fairly aimless sex farce which provides a sexy star with very little to do . as it turns out , norbert is also just as interested in axel , and makes his intentions quite apparent . writer/director sonke wortmann has created an erratic comedy which swings back and forth from being an airy trifle to half-heartedly attempting genuine character development . the opening twenty minutes promise plenty of broad laughs , from doro's discovery of axel and a lady-friend in a bathroom stall to waltraud's frantic attempts to look remove his drag costume so as not to scare off axel . it appears as though wortmann is setting up some lessons for our two protagonists to learn from each other -- norbert will learn to make better romantic choices , and axel will become a more faithful partner to doro . then maybe . . . maybe not makes a jarring u-turn back to unapologetic , bawdy slapstick , and throws any pretense at character out the window . that wouldn't necessarily be a problem , particularly because the character developments were looking fairly obvious , except that the comic situations of the last half hour are equally obvious , and not very funny . wortmann directs it all with a sluggish inevitability , and takes a final turn back to sentimentality which suggests that he was just making the whole thing up as he went along . the chiseled-cheeked schweiger has become a superstar in germany as a result of this role , and outside of his obvious sex appeal , i can't quite see why . he tries to give axel a boyish charm to counteract his incomprehensible shifts in personality , but he is the prototype pretty face with little spark . similarly , joachim krol's award-winning role seems remarkably shallow , and shows that america doesn't have a monopoly on befuddling acting honors . the problem i had with both roles , and with maybe . . . maybe not as a whole , was that there seemed to be no point to any of it , no growth of character , and some unappealing messages . every male character is perpetually horny , axel is just as big a jerk when the film ends as he was when it started , and we are reassured that everything will be fine because doro will continue to be a door-mat and forgive axel's philandering yet again . perhaps it's just a cultural gap i was unable to cross , but maybe . . . maybe not struck me as only sporadically amusing , and sometimes flat-out irritating . which is why i will never make my living deciding what movies get made . 
director : roland emmerich . whatever the production budget was for independence day , the marketing budget probably came close to matching it , and it appears to have worked . by all evidence , not a dime of it went to a good script doctor . by now , i am fully aware that the call for better scripts in summer blockbusters is a cry in the wilderness ; the success of twister has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that little else matters if impressive visual effects are on the bill of fare . what makes independence day so frustrating is that its complete failure as a story does not appear to be the result of laziness . the half-dozen or so sub-plots which wind through independence day suggest that emmerich and devlin really wanted to make human drama matter . instead , they created a story full of one-dimensional characters , absurd coincidences and laughably uninteresting interpersonal conflicts . a couple of performances manage to rise above the nonsense -- will smith , who has far more charisma than this film deserves and is almost always entertaining when he is on-screen , which is not nearly often enough ; and brent spiner , who has fun as the eccentric scientist in charge of examining the remains of the infamous roswell , new mexico spacecraft from the 1950s -- but mostly there are forced emotions and nascent cliches like the bickering-estranged-spouses-who-still-love-each-other . but let's get down to the real business : at times , independence day looks great , a real apocalypse wow . the dog-fight sequences are complex and exciting , particularly a one-on-one battle between smith's capt . hiller and an alien fighter which whizzes through canyons at break-neck speed . at other times , believe it or not , it looks cheap . some of the digital effects are too soft around the edges , and independence day skimps on a face-to-face showdown with the aliens . that is a big mistake , because the only time in independence day when there is any genuine tension is when scientists get hold of -- and have to deal with -- an alien survivor . then again , a swarming alien ground invasion might have given emmerich and devlin just one more better film to crib from . even the film's self-promoted nickname , " id4 , " evokes terminator 2 : judgment day's " t2 " campaign from a few years ago . to top things off , the president gives what is intended to be a rousing address to his hopelessly outnumbered troops ; it was supposed to be his " st . crispin's day " speech , but it's so lame it makes you wondered how this guy was ever elected _class_ president . independence day appears to be the meticulously constructed result of one of those screenwriting programs which are supposed to give you all the elements for a complete story . . . and of course , all those elements come from other films . you can't buy inspiration , and independence day is woefully short on anything that rouses the imagination . it's a kick-ass trailer that's wagging a dog . 
united states , 1995 shown at the 1996 sxsw film festival running length : 1 : 10 mpaa classification : no mpaa rating ( mature themes , profanity , grunge ) theatrical aspect ratio : 2 : 1 cast : selene vigil , janis tanaka , jasper streak , bobo , criss crass director : maria garguilo producers : maria garguilo , sheila kelly , and tami hinch screenplay : maria garguilo cinematography : lulu garguilo the year of my japanese cousin is written badly , acted poorly , and filmed with an amateurish lack of style . this is what might result from a group of people deciding to put together a movie without a clear idea of what they're attempting . the year of my japanese cousin is essentially a rock music video that's extended to seventy minutes by including elements of a trite and melodramatic narrative . the characters , like the script , are too shallow for any such meaningful exploration . in fact , aside from a couple of throw-in lines , these issues are largely ignored . writer/director maria garguilo is obviously infatuated by seattle's alternative rock scene , and all she shows a real interest in is capturing a segment of it on film . neither vigil nor tanaka shows a glimmer of acting ability . they have a lot of energy and drive , which comes across in the concert scenes , but it's dreadful to watch them attempt drama . none of the supporting performers are any better . the movie's sole attraction is the rock soundtrack . i suppose it's possible to derive limited enjoyment from the year of my japanese cousin if you close your eyes , but , even then , you'll be subjected to a barrage of inept dialogue . it's unlikely that this film will obtain significant exposure , which is fortunate , since its obscurity will spare most unaware viewers the indignity of sitting through it . 
quiz show is about a time in the late 50s that i remember from my childhood . in quiz show , the brightest , well at least those with the best memories , were the heroes . the movie about this time is directed and produced by robert redford . i remember this era , and i have read about it so i can say that the movie is a fairly accurate story with a couple of key exceptions i will cover later . what makes this movie work is the history , the reenactment of the old quiz shows , and the excellent performance of ralph fiennes as charles van doren . his cold bloodedness with no remorse in that movie was chilling in the extreme . unfortunately , there is a lot about the show that does not work . the show runs 2 : 10 but feels like 3 hours . many long scenes are unnecessary and should have been cut entirely . the script is too mushy . the purest of the pure are the congressional staffers . ah , what a contrast with today . now , the producers of 21 were bad guys . the problem with the show is that you think that the network and the sponsor was in on it too . if you stay to see all of the credits you will learn that it was never proven that either had anything to do with the scandal . they word it in such a way that you are supposed to believe that they actually did and hence were guilty until proven innocent . about the network's guilt i know nothing , but about the head of geritol ( played by martin scorsese ) i read a recent article in the wall street journal . maybe i am just a softie , but i could forgive redford his playing loose with the facts for no good reason ( the contestants and the producers of 21 provided enough bad guys to go around ) if he had just made a better movie . it needed more energy , crisper editing , and a reworked script . in the end , i have to give the film a mild thumbs up as it is an interesting story and the performance by fiennes is worth seeing . i give the show * * 1/2 . it is correctly rated pg-13 for a little mildly bad language and because it is a show that would not interest anyone under 13 . i was disappointed by this show since i thought it would be much better and because my number 2 show on my top ten list of best movies of all of the 1980s was ordinary people also directed by robert redford . oh well , . . . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
there must be something about the combination of steve martin and nora ephron that doesn't work . anyone remember my blue heaven ? ( for that matter , does anyone want to remember my blue heaven ? ) regardless of how dreadfully unfunny that martin/ephron collaboration was ( she wrote it ; he starred in it ) , it was only a precursor to mixed nuts , as unwatchable a motion picture as you're likely to find this christmas season . the movie can boast one rather impressive first , however . even though she has a fairly hefty part , juliette lewis somehow manages not to be the most annoying person on screen . at least three others have a more legitimate claim to that title . his jokes fall flat and his attempts at manic physical humor come across as forced and unnatural . there's certainly nothing here to remind an audience of her previous efforts . it boggles the mind that someone actually allowed this choppy , unpolished script to reach the production stage . there's nothing even remotely funny here . lines like " i didn't want to tell you this over the phone--i really wanted to fax you " are representative of the quality--or lack thereof--of the so-called humor . and there's a version of " deck the halls " that may make you wish you never hear the song again . mixed nuts makes a point of stating that there's magic at christmas . after seeing this movie , i'm a believer . after all , it's virtually impossible to come up with an alternate explanation of how something this awful could make it to theaters across the nation . the above represents the opinions of the author , and not necessarily those of bellcore or any organization within bellcore . 
" i'm italian , don't you understand ? " amelio's film is a political one , with a black comedic edge to it , as it traces the tragic recent history of albania , studying the dehumanizing effect bad governments have on its people . italy was flooded with a wave of albanian immigrants , looking to that country to fulfill its utopian dreams because of its material and cultural strength , but italy could not handle the onslaught of so many people , and would not let anymore immigrants in . this is a rather slow-moving film , that is chocked full of themes and universal messages the director feels impelled to get across . whether it is worthwhile or not to have a film be so politically motivated that it fails to be entertaining , is up to you to decide . the political aims seem necessary to see and understand for the viewer , the reward comes in images that stick with you long after viewing the film . therefore , this becomes a special film , not necessarily a better film , but one that is made beneficial for those who are interested enough to stick with this film's slow pace and all the political explorations that are needed to show how corrupt and decaying albania really is and how cherished the human spirit is , sometimes able to survive on the barest evidence of hope . amelio ( open doors , stolen children ) has so much political ground to cover that the film becomes overwhelmed with the misery of its exploration and suffers because of it . problems such as immigration , poverty , corruption , cultural decadence , ignorance , hate , greed , and a generation influenced by italian television are just too complicated and heavy to handle without sacrificing something in the process . what is sacrificed , is that , though i liked what i saw , i did not feel passionately about it . it was a cold but intellectually sound effort . the heart of the film lies in the change that overcomes gino . this nightmarish episode in his life is certainly profound and deadly . and that is the success of this film . we are forced into seeing the poverty that exists there , and even if we don't like to be put in that position , there is nothing that we can do about it . there are just no answers , and the film is left without a happy ending , only a few images of hope . 
story is predictable , likable , and soapy . it leaves one all fuzzy and cuddly inside , as the film uses risque material to make its point , yet it is almost totally devoid of hot sex . it traps you in its formula mode ; you can't help wishing these blokes do well . the film's popularity does not surprise me , people seem to like quick solutions to their problems and films where thinking is not a prerequisite for enjoying it . i have a feeling that this film will age poorly , and like a lot of trendy films , will not look good a few years from now . i thought it offered just so-so entertainment value . it never gave me the impression that i was seeing something that mattered . the full monty as promised , was not even delivered . 
it's the movie that everyone feared , incorrectly as it turned out , that titanic would be -- a big , expensive special effects extravaganza without a heart . and it's the kind of movie that leaves viewers angry for wasting incredible amounts of their time with such drivel . you'll laugh . you'll cry . you'll undoubtedly laugh out loud at its many sappy moments of ridiculous hokum . and you probably at least feel like crying that such an important event in our country's history has been turned into a silly romance with one clich ? d line after another . what a colossal wasted opportunity . buy the popcorn and go for the big tub . you'll need something to do as you wait forever for the movie to get to its raison d' ? tre , the destruction of most of the united states's navy at pearl harbor . all of the characters are reduced to stereotypes so that you'll likely care little when tragedy strikes them . even the movie's sex scene , which is shot with a soap commercial gloss , is laughable . sometimes the film gets so over-the-top that you begin to wonder if it is an intentional parody of a wartime romance . the trite dialog includes such gems as , " you don't dogfight with a manual , " " if i had one more night to live , i'd want to spend it with you , " " all i ever wanted was to have a home and grow old together , " and " good huntin' . " after most such lines , the music is brought up dramatically . the movie , with its heavy , syrupy score , frequently seems more like a music video than a movie . the trailer scenes form the body of the movie's only successful part , the half-hour section that occurs just past the midpoint in this endurance contest of a picture -- it's over three hours long . my advice to you is to arrive ninety minutes late since nothing , absolutely nothing , of interest happens until the japanese zeros arrive to obliterate our fleet . what , you will be asking yourself frequently during this period , does this all have to do with pearl harbor ? and , as you twiddle your thumbs waiting for something to happen , you'll keep asking yourself , " why does this story have to be over three hours long ? " which brings us to the movie's most intriguing revelation . in a fascinating bit of revisionist history , the movie has the japanese leader explain how they were forced into it . kind of makes you wonder what insights a bruckheimer story about hitler would divulge about his real motives . if you're willing to put up with the saccharine nonsense of the first half , the movie's middle section -- a cgi tour de force -- will send chills up your spine as our boys are almost completely annihilated and sent to watery graves in which many still lie . the computer generated effects are awesome , which is a good argument for seeing a film about the making of pearl harbor . " i'm not going to make it , " one of the brave soldiers says at the end . i know just how he feels . i barely made it through the long ordeal of watching the movie . it is rated pg-13 for sustained intense war sequences , images of the wounded , brief sensuality and some language and would be acceptable for teenagers . its pg-13 rating is quite questionable since the horrific scenes of the wartime wounded , who squirt blood everywhere , are much more intense than you'd ever expect to find in a pg-13 film . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
all right , i'm not saying people flocked to white men can't jump or indecent proposal thanks to his name above the title . nevertheless , harrelson has demonstrated an enviable talent for picking hits , even if that has been the only thing he has really demonstrated in his fledgling big screen career . the cowboy way is in for a much harder ride towards success , facing stiff summer competition , but whatever its box office take , there might be more in it for harrelson to be proud of personally than any of his previous films . given the challenge of carrying a film for the first time , he takes a tedious formula picture and singlehandedly makes it at least moderately endearing . i could easily name fifty variations on this particular theme which have graced the screen since i have been a regular movie-goer ; fish-out-of-water comedy is as venerable a genre as the western itself . the cowboy way fits every one perfectly creating that comfortable familiarity filmmakers seek much more frequently than originality . the tweaks to that formula the cowboy way incorporates run from the obvious ( the friendly cop has a romance with cowboy mythology ) to the mildly interesting ( dylan mcdermott's insecure villain ) , but let's be frank . the cowboy way does not , nor was it meant to , dazzle with its inventiveness . in fact , there are long stretches when it's a crashing bore . the showpiece here is the energetic performance of woody harrelson , who has a great deal of fun with the lovably oafish pepper . in many ways , the cowboy way plays like little more than a series of setups for pepper to do something stupid , which could have been a nightmare if so many of those stupid things weren't so funny . as long as harrelson was on the screen , the cowboy way kept me smiling . if only there was one interesting person for him to interact with . kiefer sutherland continues to show that screen presence is a recessive sutherland family trait , reading every line as though he had something on the stove that he really needed to get back to . sonny is supposed to be level-headed , but sutherland interprets " level-headed " as " comatose , " much as he did in last year's the three musketeers . the cowboy way is a tired premise filled with tired-looking actors , but woody harrelson was able to lasso me by the neck and take me along for the ride . i'd like to see a home video version where the plot is edited out entirely ; it just ends up getting in harrelson's way . 
i suppose there are a lot of generation xers who harbor a certain fondness for the old tv cartoon george of the jungle , which ran on saturday mornings in the late '60s and early '70s ( apparently , there were only 17 episodes produced , but they were rerun so often that it seemed like a lot more ) . as a result , it was only to be expected that in this era of re-hashing tv products for the big screen , someone would stumble upon george . the outcome is a live-action re-interpretation of the cartoon that , despite changing numerous details , remains faithful to the spirit of its inspiration . however , perhaps the most surprising thing about this movie is that it's far more entertaining than one might reasonably expect given the premise . disney is stuck in a remake rut , and some of their recent efforts ( 101 dalmatians and that darn cat in particular ) have been less-than- inspired . and , while george of the jungle isn't likely to top many critics' end-of-the-year top 10 lists , it's a breath of fresh air coming from a studio that has become known for its stagnant , family values- oriented treacle . george of the jungle possesses both an edge and a sense of self-mocking that's unusual for any feature , live or animated , that emerges from under the mouse's protective umbrella . arguably , the best thing about the original george of the jungle was the theme song , and it has been retained in its full glory ( albeit slightly altered -- some of the lyrics aren't the same ) . however , while that's the movie's most recognizable and most frequently-repeated comic routine , george manages to be more than just a one-joke picture . george of the jungle's plot borrows heavily from the likes of king kong , crocodile dundee , and , of course , tarzan . does this sound stupid and silly ? yes , but that's the whole point , and director sam weisman ( bye bye , love ) , his cast , and crew all recognize it and revel in it . by adopting the tone of the cartoon series , george of the jungle manages to appeal to children , while some of the unexpectedly clever humor will keep adults from becoming too restless . the film pokes fun at everything from " serious " jungle epics to disney's own the lion king . for those who prefer " least common denominator " humor , there's plenty of flatulence , and some of the double entendres are salacious enough to push the limits of the pg-rating . the best running gag doesn't involve george crashing into a tree ; instead , it satirizes one of my least-favorite motion picture devices : the voiceover narrative . the disembodied vocal talent in george of the jungle belongs to keith scott , who sounds astonishingly like don pardo . omniscient and without form , he emotes alliterative , flowery prose with tongue in cheek . some of his observations are slyly amusing ; others are downright hilarious . that's right : a voiceover narrator trading insults with a character . using the same vacuous expression he displayed to good effect in encino man and airheads , brendan fraser is suitably bland as george . the comedy in george of the jungle is not sophisticated , but it is frequently audacious and irreverent . technically , george of the jungle isn't as polished as disney's most recent animated feature , hercules , but , on a certain level , it offers a better entertainment value . the film delights in its own daffiness , and the relatively short running length avoids overkill . the result is one of disney's most lively non- animated features in years . 
i suppose high art is as good a name as any for this pretentious melodrama , an often-diverting but ultimately pointless attempt to wed intellectual twaddle with a soap-opera-ish lesbian romance . lisa cholodenko's film , which had its world premiere in competition at the 1998 sundance film festival , received a decidedly mixed reception there , but was widely praised by feminists more because of its theme of female empowerment than because of a particularly original or engaging script . these are both real characters beset by believable angst . the attraction is palpable and both actresses give capable performances . ally sheedy , who is best known for undemanding roles ( such as in the breakfast club and only the lonely ) , is surprisingly effective cast against type ( although i think some of the praise heaped upon her for this role has been overstated ? she's good , but not excellent ) . frankly , though , i wish the movie had spent a little more time concentrating on syd alone and less on her sexual liaison with lucy . although better developed than most motion picture lesbian affairs , it's fundamentally not all that compelling . her script delves into themes of female empowerment , the war between ambition and affection , the effects of star power , and the balance between art and commercialism . none of these ideas ( many of which are glossed over ) are effectively presented . they are either woven into the plot in an obvious , chunky fashion ( all that's missing is a neon sign saying " look ! important issue ahead ! " ) or introduced through the pretentious drivel that the characters spout at one another . aside from syd and lucy , the characters are either irritating or complete non-entities . all men fall into the latter category . visually , high art is impressive . the film's appearance is , as the title implies , artistic , and cholodenko's presentation of the female/female sex scene is lush and sensual . the director also displays an aptitude for developing atmosphere ( consider , for example , the exotic setting of lucy's apartment ) . however , while such a sumptuous style makes it more enjoyable to look at the picture , it's far from everything needed for a successful endeavor . despite solid performances in the two major roles , high art's script is too talky and uneven to make this really worthwhile , unless , of course , you're a fan of arty soap operas . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
first , let me be clear . director mike figgis's mr . jones ( 1993 ) , staring richard gere as mr . jones , is an extremely hard show to watch . think of it as paying $7 for a virtual reality game where you too can be a manic depressive and for two solid hours no less ! second , the ending is awful . actually , for this bit of ridiculousness , i do thank them somewhat . without it , the show was so intense it might have been totally unbearable . finally , the title is terrible . mr . jones sounds like a love story or a light comedy . now , why in my right mind ( no pun intended ) , would i recommend this show and give it a high rating ( * * * 1/2 ) ? first , gere performance , especially in his manic states , was pure academy award winning stuff . second , it forces you , albeit very painfully , to come to grips with what depression is and even more so what manic depression is . every time gere got into his manic state , you felt like you had just popped a bottle of speed . this is one of those show you think about again and again for years . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : october 28 , 1993 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
the production also changed screenwriters , as david mamet's script was rejected and his script was replaced by steven zaillian's . the film is stylistically pleasing to the eye . its serial killer scenes are excessive , but they do allow for comedy to soften the blows and , also , since all the victims were not particularly nice people , watching them being mutilated was made more bearable . the film can be divided into three parts and all with different results . the film's opening is meticulously choreographed , showing in detail how a police bust can go sour . the film's second part taking place in italy , is brilliantly conceived and acted , it is the heart of the film , with its visual effects matching its dialogue and storytelling . though , even this part of the film has its faults , as some scenes will drag on for far too long , allowing a tedium to creep into the story . the last part , when back in the washington , dc area , is a total gross-out , that brings the film down to a mundane campy level , as bad taste takes over , making for a very sloppy and exploitive surprise ending . overall , this sequel didn't live up to the high-pulp-art standards of the original , but it was still successful in being a technically superior cinematic happening and the quality of the acting was always first-rate . hopkins's riveting performance is interlaced with wit and a sense of the genteel , though it also comes with some over-the-top moves ( though there are no slurping tongue sounds when he goes into his cannibalistic mode as in the original ) . the nervous , icy but vulnerable persona that moore ably brought to her role , much like foster played it , keyed in on her fight with male authority figures who can't accept her because she's different than they are , more than with her mental chess game with lecter as in the original . in the climactic scenes , hannibal comes back to the states , and his long-anticipated meeting with clarice takes place -- which turns out to be a fizzle , or a real lame-brained idea on how to put a twist in the plot that becomes unnecessarily twisted . the film , that was faithful to thomas harris' novel until this point , now goes off on ridley scott's own direction and it becomes an absurd mess , with nothing working right , and all its good work is nearly eaten away by the director's bad instincts . what can you say , but sometimes you try something new and it just doesn't taste right . 
there are two kinds of viewers for the x-files movie : those have seen at least a few episodes of the tv series and those who have never watched it . i am a member of the latter group , so that's the perspective from which this review is written . as a result , i cannot assess how the film will appeal to a die-hard follower of the program . but , for the " uneducated " movie-goer , the x-files offers two hours of solid entertainment . ( of course , one unanswered question is how many non-x files aficionados will exhibit sufficient interest to venture into a theater showing this picture . ) transferring a television program to the big screen has become a routine procedure for a film industry starved for ideas , but this is a rare occasion when the movies continue the adventures begun on the small screen , with no re-casting involved . twentieth century fox is hoping the wrinkle : the television series is still going strong . in interviews , writer/producer/series creator chris carter has stated that his goal with the x-files was to make a movie that could stand on its own . there's no question that he has succeeded . the script can be followed by someone with literally no previous knowledge of the characters or situations . ( by " cleverly , " i mean that these passages don't cry out , " character exposition ! " ) although i'm told that the storyline picks up where the last season of the tv program left off , there's no sense that new viewers are entering in the middle of things . the only obvious concession to the ongoing series is the ending , which includes several hooks that can be used to launch stories in the upcoming season . mulder and scully have exchanged their investigations of things paranormal and extraterrestrial for more mundane matters such as terrorism . plot-wise , the x-files bears more than a passing resemblance to 1996's alien invasion/conspiracy movie , the arrival . although things get sloppy near the end , when several story holes are ignored or ineffectively plugged , the script as a whole exhibits an uncommon intelligence for this type of movie . in addition , director rob bowman ( who has helmed a number of the tv episodes ) maintains a fairly high level of tension as the complexities of the multi-layered plot mount . the movie is perhaps a little too long ; cutting ten or fifteen minutes would have made for a better focused adventure . it's not hard to understand the appeal of mulder and scully . it also doesn't hurt that they're both likable and neither is hard on the eyes . actors david duchovny ( who's no stranger to movies ; his most recent foray being playing god ) and gillian anderson ( who is more familiar to viewers of the small screen than the large one ) are both accomplished and entirely believable in these roles . of course , we would expect no less of them , since they have been inhabiting these fictitious shells for five years . the chemistry between them is palpable , blending camaraderie and respect with a little subtle romance . having seen the movie , it's easy for me to comprehend why so many people are enamored with the series . although a lot of the material explored in the x-files isn't new or revolutionary , the style of presentation and the quality of the writing set this above most other conspiracy theory/alien invasion pictures . i won't claim that the experience of having watched this film will suddenly convert me into a weekly viewer of the tv show , but at least now i'm aware of what awaits if i choose to catch an episode . in a summer that has been characterized by over-hyped and largely pointless big-budget films , the offerings .

screenplay : tom schulman . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 93 minutes . is this the plot to weekend at bernie's iii . no , no , thank merciful god in heaven , no . the film in question is 8 heads in a duffel bag , and it's not nearly as awful as its plot or direct-to-video-style title might suggest . there area few moments of gruesome comic brilliance in 8 heads in a duffel bag , most of them involving the strange fates which continuously befall the heads . makeup artist greg cannom ( the mask ) does a delightful job of creating the heads , which keep turning up at inconvenient moments and end up providing the film's best scene during a sweet rendition of " mr . sandman . " when schulman is willing to push the limits of good taste , 8 heads in a duffel bag produces some big laughs , but he should have been willing to push those limits even further , and more often . for the first half of the film , charlie and the bennett family scream and fumble around in a posh mexican hotel in a strained manner , with newcomer comeau trying to carry the farce on his thin shoulders . he needs a lot more help than can be provided by dyan cannon and george hamilton , however ; their presence only serves to give you the feeling that you're watching a dark-humored episode of " the love boat . " while he has a bizarre and original plot device at his disposal , schulman inexplicably resorts to unpleasant mexican stereotypes , cannon's incessant shrieking and a parade of pratfalls . the great gag in pesci's scenes with spade and comeau is that he's much more simple and creative in the tortures he devises for his wimpy captives . it's a great , goofy spin on pesci's stock character , and it gives 8 heads some of its best moments . too bad only pesci seems to realize that fact . schulman actually doesn't seem to know what he wants to do with the characters , resulting sloppy and fairly pointless attempts at providing motivation . none of these snippets of personality amount to anything , however ; they're stock situations which don't even yield stock resolutions . schulman just lets his direction and script wander , getting terribly conventional at the oddest moments and pulling back when he should have been ready to go for the jugular . 8 heads in a duffel bag is just too uneven to be satisfying , even if some individual gags work to perfection . when you're throwing body parts at the audience , you've got to offer more than half-hearted whimsy . 
no escape is a non-stop action flick in the steven seagal genre . you get to witness lots and lots of people dying many different horrible deaths in front of your very eyes . especially popular are impalements , but decapitations are also quite the rage . actually , i like some of these extreme action movies , but only if there is a fast paced story behind it all as in die hard or under siege and only if you can care about the people . no escape had neither of these attributes . can you imagine a hollywood movie where a big business was not evil ? oh well , i digress . the jokes manage rarely to be funny however . the script by michael gaylin , joel gross , and richard herley was full of nonsense laced with failed attempts at humor . the major failing of the movie is that of the director , martin campbell , and the script writers . they have made characters that you do not care if they live or die . maybe if they had edited it down to 30 minutes , it would have worked as a " twilight zone " episode , but 1 hour and 58 minutes was way too long . the sets here were cute if a bit ridiculous . prisons in 2022 it turns out will look a lot like 13th century china complete with costumes for warriors of that era . my biggest disappointment was with ray liotta . he played one of the scariest ex-cons ever in jonathan demme's something wild and has been excellent in many other shows since , e . , goodfellas and unlawful entry . in this movie , he is , well , boring . his performance was that of robocop but without robocop's humor . don't waste your money . i give it * since it was not a bad show just a monotonous one . it is rated r for all of the above mentioned gory violence . it is probably okay for older teenagers if they feel like they have to see it . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : april 29 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
a . i . this is one of the great dark comedies of the 1950s . the opening scene is a memorable one . he begins by saying : " i would like to say a few words about weddings . i've just been through one . " even the caterer ( leo g . carroll ) , proves to be an unpleasant problem to deal with , as stanley wryly says , " an experienced caterer can make you ashamed of your house in fifteen minutes . " 
the australians have a knack for screwball comedies that are actually funny . american filmmakers too often confuse humor with bad taste . writer and director gerard lee's 1995 film all men are liars was a box office sensation in australia . i saw it at san jose's cinequest film festival . since i said it was an australian comedy , you might leap to the conclusion that the film was about cross-dressing . if you did , you'd be right . all men are liars is funny , sweet , and romantic . i'll outline the main action , but there are more subplots than you can count . you are likely to leave the show arguing with your friends about what part was the best . let me state my opinion upfront . both are wonderful actors , and they make it is easy for the audience to live their romance vicariously . it is sugar week in a small-town in the middle of nowhere in australia . jarratt has one of the best parts of the film and manages to steal most of the scenes he is in . it is a family heirloom of hers , and if the piano goes , she goes too . other than the delicious in-joke about the piano , irene's whole part only serves to slow down the action and should have been eliminated . campion's signature film is the piano , so having a piano play a promenade role in lee's picture was no accident . you can probably guess the basic structure of the rest of the story , but the beauty is in the details . most of them are small but delightful , with the best little scene dominated by larry , the boys' pet lizard . the moral of this vignette is don't take a lizard on a date . david price is terrific as michelle . their romance is delightful and innocent -- from the classic scene where they almost skinny-dip to the one of michelle changing clothes off-screen . both of the leads are lovable , and the script has just enough poignancy in it to make you care and worry about them . there are some fun musical numbers too . toni pearen is a popular singer in australia , and i liked her naturalness much better than the constant mugging for the camera that was prevalent in a recent all-musical movie that i endured . the script is smart and upbeat . it works more by its character development and its joke setups than by its one-liners . still , i remember the line of the local stud . the stud's pathetic cry is , " if i need therapy for this , you're paying for it . " a show with a great ending , and one that leaves a song in your heart and a contagious feeling of joy . in australia it was rated pg , but has not been rated by our mpaa . i suspect it will get a pg or a pg-13 rating . there is a brief shot of rear male nudity , and i think there may have been a little profanity that i forgot to record in my notes . the show should be fine for kids ten and up . i loved this little gem and recommend it to you . i give the film * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 31 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
" how can we bring civilization to the stars if we can't remain civilized ? " welcome to yet another dysfunctional film family , the robinsons . from stephen hopkins , the director of predator 2 and nightmare on elm street 5 , and akiva goldsman , the writer of batman forever and batman & robin , we have a deadly serious treatment of a classic television series that delighted solely on the charm of its goofy props and silly sentences . the cinematic version of lost in space seems to be a didactic franz kafka space story written for older children . so somber in tone , you'll swear this must be a message movie , but looking into the story's thoughts is like staring into a black hole . his crime is that he's been spending too much time at the office and has missed his son's science fair again this year . in the only notable casting in the film , jack johnson plays the intelligent and sweet 10-year-old , will , who controls the robot . as the older daughter judy , lacey chabert , who was the sex kitten in boogie nights , gives a cold performance that only comes alive the few times she manages to smile . in a plot that is either confusing or non-existent - you can choose - the movie limps along between some dazzling but too darkly lit special effects . with all the money they spent , it's too bad they couldn't have afforded a few more light bulbs . but with 750 special effects , as the press notes claim , it is easy to ignore the lack of a script and concentrate on the visuals . ( and on the aforementioned excellent piece of acting in the central role of the boy . ) landing at a random place and time in the future , they get to fight giant spiders like , but not nearly as believable as , the insects in starship troopers . there is a great scene for kids in which will uses a cool looking holographic interface to battle the bugs remotely . the main failing in the picture is not the pathetic script but instead is the way they blow it with the robot . the endearing hunk of junk of the original television series starts off life in the new lost in space as a killer mechanical beast , looking like something straight out of robocop . although the family is saved at the last minute by will , the new robot never achieves the charm of the old . and the movie gets as lost as the family . the picture's morose ending includes equal mixtures of childhood angst , dark ruminations on the effects of absent fathers , and an ugly monster lifted from aliens . it is rated pg-13 for profanity , science fiction violence , and a scary monster and would be fine for kids around nine and up . my son jeffrey , age 9 , gave it * * * * and said he absolutely loved the movie because of all of its space stuff . eliot called it " junk , " and nickolas and matthew complained that it didn't have a story or a plot . 
let's cut to the chase and answer the second most important question in every moviegoer's mind . but , the phantom menace is a visually audacious triumph whose look far surpasses the first three . a thoroughly entertaining motion picture , it is a pg-rated treat for the entire family . this brings me to the most asked question , how do you snag some early tickets to the most widely anticipated film since gone with the wind ? to this cinematic conundrum , this review will offer no guidance . written and directed by george lucas , the movie works best when it's at its busiest . as armies of computer-generated figures war with each other , the movie infuses the audience with a visceral excitement that's palpable . your adrenaline will pump as if you personally are taking on those cleverly designed robotic soldiers of the future . if the look and the impressive sound are the picture's high points , the charisma-challenged characters are its low points . the uninspired casting features some well-known actors who seem oddly out of place and some new actors who don't . there isn't a han solo class character to be found anywhere on this mission . harrison ford , with his macho swagger and his humorous energy and charm , is sadly missed . no one with his abilities is found anywhere in this cast . if some are to the manor born , ford's natural home is in a space opera series like star wars or an old-fashioned adventure anthology like indiana jones . giving restrained and wooden performances , these fine actors look like they feel awkward and somehow slightly embarrassed in their roles . i expected them to warm up to their characters , but they never did . both act way below their potential . with all looks and no menace , darth maul's no darth vader , not even close . he's more like a video game opponent who's waiting to be sliced and diced . this reminded me of the scene from spinal tap , in which they claim that their band is the best because the volume on their amplifier goes to 11 rather 10 like the other bands' amplifiers do . much has already been written about the latter , with people divided between those who find jake lloyd's performance endearing and those who think it's lifeless . with his confident charm he is the one of the best reasons to get excited about the future episodes . the movie's most exhilarating scene comes in a big pod racing extravaganza that's lifted straight out of ben hur . the technological tour de force crowd scenes alone are worth the price of admission . a two-headed race announcer supplies the humor in a picture that is sadly bereft of much comedy . the lovable r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) and c-3po ( anthony daniels ) are back , but they aren't allocated anywhere near the screen time that they deserve -- a waste of one of moviedom's best comedy duos . the dialog has classic star wars lingo . ( " be wary , i feel a disturbance in the force , " is one of the many canonical lines . ) the retreads are fun , but what is missing are many memorable new lines . john williams's wonderfully dramatic music draws heavily on his previous work for the series yet still manages to be fresh . gavin bocquet's lavish sets are visually enthralling with the queen's large italian renaissance palace with its massive marble columns being among the handsomest . but the thin and sometimes confusing plot is all just a backdrop for the action . the middle section of the movie gets bogged down with the machinations of senate bureaucrats squabbling over issues ranging from taxes to trade to leadership . sometimes , you may feel like screaming at the screen , " all right already , let's get back to the action . " if we want to hear about bickering politicians , we can read the newspaper . so is the phantom menace a disappointment ? a little . the first three movies were such a huge success and built such a loyal following of fans ; the hype that ensued was to be expected . with such enormous hype comes an inevitable disappointment . but is the movie one that you wouldn't want to miss ? absolutely . see it on the largest screen you can find and with the best sound possible . this is a big event . don't miss it . and don't even consider waiting until it comes out on video . star wars episode i - the phantom menace runs 2 : 11 . it is rated pg for some sci-fi violence and would be fine for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 10 , thought it was almost better than the first 3 and gave it * * * * . he went on and on about the things he liked , including the music , the relationships , the figures and the action . he couldn't think of anything in the movie he didn't like . 
the quote that was foremost in my mind as i sat down to watch the fact-based rosewood came from director john singleton : " i am concerned about absolute historical accuracy to an extent , but i am really more worried about being truthful to the essence of what happened at rosewood . . . i am making a movie that people will respond to . " indeed , this motion picture , which combines the flavor of a john ford western with singleton's uniquely visceral power , is an epic that stands alone in the latter weeks of a dismal movie winter . neither came close to the impact of the director's first feature . despite an occasional narrative hiccup , this is a rich and moving motion picture . if singleton takes liberties with the historical account of what happened at rosewood ( and that account is murky at best -- the death count differs greatly depending on which source is being consulted ) , it's in the name of dramatic license , and it works . this is a deeply affecting tale about the naked emotional and physical devastation that can be wrought by racial hatred . but it is also a story of hope that highlights the indomitable nature of the human spirit and the fraternity that can bind together two apparently different people . rosewood does not glamorize evil , but neither does it demonize those who practice it . singleton is careful to present a balanced and believable picture of the participants on both sides . the result presents a forceful message without ever preaching . jon voight and ving rhames , both of whom appeared in last summer's blockbuster , mission impossible , lead an impressive cast . while both voight and rhames are exemplary , they are ably supported . and bruce mcgill portrays one of the most chillingly realistic crackers ever to appear on screen . his is a startling performance because he defies tradition by not going over-the-top . while rosewood must be seen as a cohesive whole to be fully appreciated , there are isolated moments that stand out because of their haunting power . one of the most startling depicts white folk picnicking and frolicking while rosewood burns in the background . there are , in fact , times when rosewood is reminiscent of schindler's list . there's a kernel of truth that both films have in common -- the theme of the duality of human nature : the capacity for great good and great evil , boundless love and infinite hatred . and , while this film is not as well-paced or tightly-structured as spielberg's holocaust drama , it evokes many of the same feelings and emotions . it is an important film that should not be missed . 
" open your eyes " asks a lot of questions , such as : how do you know if you are awake or dreaming ? how do you know if you are sane or mad ? how do you know what is real or fantasy ? how do you know if you killed someone or not ? this stylish work , filmed in all the sleekness of a modern madrid inhabited by the affluent young , tells its jarring tale in a non-linear way , sure to confuse even the most avid moviegoer . he has the smile of a professional charmer and the warmth of a snake . if you like playing guessing games and are taken with the slickness of this bold but not exactly fresh script ( i've seen mind-games like this played-out in some recent films , including " the game " ) , then you will have a more favorable impression of the film than i did . i felt it tried to be interesting , and touched on many different genres , from romance to sci-fi , to tell its kafkaesque denouement , but it was not particularly a moving experience . i felt uninvolved , finding myself easily drifting into my own dreamworld , and as diverting , beautifully acted and photographed , and entertaining as the film was , i thought it was mostly about style and not ideas . 
the game is a manipulative but entertaining film that falls far short of director fincher's more successful , seven . the game takes on dangerous pretensions , as douglas wonders if this is really a game or is it to be taken for real , or is he just being scammed . we watch him begin to unravel , and you are perhaps feeling like i do at this point of the story , that i am being set-up , following a tale that is so unbelievable , that i am being taken for a sucker to buy into this . anyway , we are not that concerned about douglas , maybe that's because we don't have much to go on why he is as obnoxious and joyless as he is , except we learn that his father committed suicide when he was a child and he never quite got over it . the best feature of the film is its unpredictability , it is what sucks you into watching the entire film expecting something sensational to take place . i thought any ending would be apt . i never got a sense that what was happening mattered . and when you become conscious that what is going on is all acting and only acting , even if films are just that , nevertheless , they should hold out the illusion that what is on screen is real , and if that is not so , then it becomes natural to lose interest in the story and you become prepared to accept whatever it is that you see happening on the screen , whatever the director wants to put in , any logic will do . i felt nothing as i watched to see if douglas will commit suicide , or if this is really an on-the-level game , or if douglas will be transformed by the game into a better human being ( which to me would be the phoniest way for this film to end ) . so when i saw what actually developed , i could only think of how clever this filmmaker is , that he used the same formula that someone making toothpaste commercials might use to catch the consumer's attention . art is more metaphorical than that , commercial films are not , their bottom line is always the almighty dollar and the gimmick that will get it for them . this film should be pleasing to those who like to play games . the director is a graduate from the video and advertising world , well able to work in that slick media market , who has come up with a novel idea for a film but one that falls short in being credible . 
it's a fascinating snapshot of indian culture in the 1930s , and a cautionary tale about the dangers of an inflated opinion of self-worth . their reactions to these crushing circumstances are predictably different -- the resilient apu fights on ; the pampered huzar gives up . the music room is a large chamber , with gorgeous , crystal chandeliers , a giant mirror at one end , and pictures of huzar's ancestors decorating the walls . in the apu trilogy , ray drew us into the protagonist's world , encouraging us to empathize with apu through his triumphs and tragedies . in jalsaghar , the director's approach is different . he distances the audience from the characters , allowing us to observe the culture and events from a detached perspective . as a result , while this movie lacks the sublime beauty and simple power of the apu films , it is no less intellectually involving . that's not to say that jalsaghar has no emotional impact , but the intent is different . seen in concert with the apu trilogy , jalsaghar makes for a fascinating study of similarities and contrasts , and helps us see another level of ray's cinematic mastery . this is a very visual film -- there are numerous ingenious shots ( including one where a spider crawls up the leg of a painted figure ) and a stirring dance sequence . while i don't think this movie reaches the pinnacle achieved by aparajito and apur sansar , it is nevertheless an intriguing and , at times , beguiling motion picture that deserves its place among the director's masterworks . 
if you have been lucky enough to spent some time in ireland as i did for three weeks , you know how beautiful it is . the movie shows off beautiful scenery without tending to overpower the story as some movies do , e . g . , legends of the fall . the cinematography by kenneth macmillan was peaceful and serene in a natural and graceful way . i think this may the age of the wallflowers . as you would guess , there are complications and complexities . it would be nice to have religion appear in a movie every now and then in a positive light . after all , we have lots of movie glorifying everything from gangsters to heavy drinking to you name it . oh well , . . . the problem with the movie is that , based on the information i just gave you , you could write the script now , and you would probably be close . the writer ( andrew davies ) took no risks , and the result is a completely predictable plot . the director ( pat o'donnell ) went the safe route as well making for a nicely homogenized show . this is all quite surprising since the talent of minnie driver was clear and yet was so often underutilized . moreover , the writer also wrote the very inventive script for the to play the king british series recently on pbs here and the director did the extremely moving and imaginative movie cal . although it could have been much better , and although i was able to forecast every turn in the movie , i did enjoy being a member of benny's circle of friends for a couple of hours . she was a character i'm glad i got to know . her strength of conviction and her charm wove a spell on me . it is rated pg-13 for sexual discussions and scenes . there is no nudity of any kind and no violence . the movie would be fine for anyone old enough to be seriously interested in romance , say 10 and above i guess . i give the movie a mild thumbs up with the reservations mentioned above , and i award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : march 31 , 1995 opinions expressed are solely mine & not meant to reflect my employer's . 
it seems obvious , but it is the most pivotal point of the film . the sounds heard from the factory or the music in the background , signal the extremes of pleasure and pain felt . the romantic maudlin gypsy music that opens the film , is followed by the oppressive factory sounds- a source of confinement and class differences . it is not a very optimistic ending for a film that touches on subjects that are not very comfortable areas for discussion . the film , in the social realism mode of many eastern european films , is lighter than most films of this ilk , but what it can't overcome is the total bleakness of its subject matter and how too many of its responses must be considered as clich ? s to a western audience . nevertheless , this is a powerful and well made film , and the performance of katalin berek , in a role where she defies social conventions but who must be someone that the audience can empathize with , is handled with a quiet dignity and aplomb . the entire ensemble cast is well suited to bring off this drama in a successful way , making one wonder , that even when the bureaucrats are seen as benevolent and people are finally sympathetic to a young girl's plight , life is still difficult . and for the middle-age kata , life is so unjust , that even her well intentioned gestures might not be enough to overcome the problematic nature of a country that seems to be stuck in its own malaise . 
with her toothy smile and red curly hair , she looks more like a seductress from a d . h . lawrence novel than a princess . ( although i liked kolya , the academy award winner for best foreign language film last year , my favorite of the nominees remains berit nesheim's the other side of sunday . sadly , it is the only one that still does not have a u . s . distributor . the word action is probably a misnomer since little " action " transpires in a chef in love . the script by andre graill and irakli kvirikadze meanders from one small event to the other with no narrative drive joining them , which is not necessarily bad . with strong acting , characters can imbue any scene with power and relevance . the two leads , richard and presle , in a chef in love , are quite good looking , but their acting in this film is rarely compelling . pascal is both an opera singer and a chef . with a title of a chef in love , i expected many sumptuous scenes of food with lots of close-ups , but the scenes rarely occur , and the cinematography by georgi beridze is pleasing but nothing special . the movie becomes little more than a series of disconnected incidents . none of the film's episodes are involving , and the whole movie left me feeling cold and detached . a handsome film certainly , but i've seen much prettier . even if i credit the film with more beauty than it possesses , the movie is like a meringue -- briefly tasty , but with no substance . it is in french with some georgian , and both are subtitled in english . the film is rated pg-13 for brief nudity and a little profanity . it would be fine for kids say 9 and up . i am not able to recommend the film , but do give it * * for its nice images . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : may 1 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
it stars a famous , gorgeous foreign actress ( juliette binoche ) who boldly appears quite unattractive . it features unhappy and unsympathetic characters whose actions dare you to like them , but whose circumstances are so dire that you feel guilty if you don't . finally it has a director who figures that , if he doesn't proceed with excruciating slowness , you will not appreciate the gravity of the characters' situations and the importance of the material . in short , it's the high-minded type of film that will have those less dedicated filmgoers heading for the exits before the first 15 long minutes have elapsed . to be fair the actors try hard , perhaps too hard , and the images , especially those of the steel-gray parisian twilight , are handsomely filmed . with a patch over one eye , a cut and bruised lip and a splotchy complexion , binoche's normally striking beauty is completely masked . mich ? le and alex strike up an almost instant friendship and like nothing better than swigging cheap wine from identical large bottles until they obtain the desired degree of inebriation . with realistic background sounds and little dialog , the movie has the feel of a documentary . it's hard to criticize a picture like this with its lofty intentions , but it is even harder to sit through it all . this much can be said , the director does make living an indigent and alcoholic life look pretty unappealing . the problem is that in the process he makes watching the movie just as undesirable . the movie is in french with english subtitles . it is rated r for violence , language , sexuality/nudity and substance abuse and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature . 
the gimmicky premise grabs your attention , but the film fails to maintain its suspense as the story line becomes increasingly more absurd . why the nondescript , everyman character played by depp , would believe that walken wouldn't kill his daughter anyway , even if he did kill the governor , is just one of the major flaws in this ridiculous premise . if you buy into the story line , then you should find the film suspenseful in the hitchcock style . if you don't , the only consolation is that the acting was good . as far as i'm concerned , it was a preposterous premise and even if believed , the plan was far too risky and complicated for those involved , and there is no way the high insiders in the governor's camp wouldn't have come up with another plan to use , like the usual one of a professional assassin with a high-powered rifle . the only surprise the film could have for me , is if both depp's daughter and the governor were killed . this unnotable suspense yarn , brings little to the table and concludes with an unsatisfying ending -- which was more silly than tense . director john badham ( " saturday night fever''/ " stakeout'' ) tells the story effectively in real time , which makes it a watchable though forgettable film . 
yes , it's b movie time . in 1958 , writer stirling silliphant -- whose name sounds like a playful pseudonym but who is actually the academy award winning writer of in the heat of the night -- and director don siegel gave the world the imminently forgettable the lineup . based on a popular tv series of the time , the trite dialog sounds like lines " dragnet " would have rejected for not having enough punch . the plot has possibilities , but the execution is quite risible . the conundrum is whether mr . dressler knew about the heroin or not . remember , this was a time of low technology and hence especially easy smuggling . the show is laced with " memorable " lines . aside from laughing at the dialog , the film provides other pleasures , the chief one being that of seeing key san francisco landmarks -- war memorial opera house , steinhart aquarium , and others -- as they looked forty years ago . toward the end , the plot takes some interesting twists before it dissolves into a formula chase scene . " you'll get us out of here and get us out of here fast . " so why didn't i mention the lineup you ask ? because it was there but was so inconsequential to the story line that it wasn't even worth bringing up . the lineup runs a blazingly fast 1 : 00 , which is about the right length . it is not rated but would certainly get a g . saturday morning cartoons are more violent , and drugs are only mentioned but not shown . kids of any age could watch it , but anyone less than 12 would probably not understand the humor in it all . the film is not quite worth recommending , but it is fun to laugh at . i give it * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : august 16 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
told with heavy narration , the film possesses a realistic nostalgia blended with the magic of youthful dreams and tribulations . the movie's director is david mickey evans , who wrote the script with robert gunter , and together they have created a show that has the essence of truth as if in a biography but with the liberties of a coming of age comedy . the game never ends , they don't keep score and there are no sides . they play for the pure exhilaration of the sport , which they all worship . the adults in the picture have quite brief , but important roles . ( perhaps the reason i like the story so much is that smalls's baseball ability or lack thereof reminds me so much of myself when i was his age . balls would fly past me , going under my legs or over my head but rarely into my glove . " actually it was an a- , but it should have been a b . " the insults in the movie are true to form for fifth graders without trying to shock the audience . when a bunch of kids so rich that they can afford uniforms show up on their shiny new bikes , the insults fly fast and furiously . " and that's the way you like it . " wow , is that an insult or what ? chester kaczenski's sets are so perfect as to be totally unrealistic but great for nostalgia . the wide lawns are manicured to perfection , and there is not a scratch on anything except for the sandlot area which is in a genteel state of disrepair . perhaps it is different now , but then girls were something that fifth grade boys ogled and dreamed about , but rarely had the courage to do more than flirt with . so it is with the sandlot boys . the show's great ensemble cast of unknowns is at its best in the finale . seen only in glimpses until the end , its roar and reputation are awesome . the well paced and compelling ending shows how inventive grade-schoolers can be at solving tough problems . and how courage is sometimes essential . i thought i had the conclusion guessed , but i was surprised . the sandlot runs a breezy 1 : 41 . it is rated pg for some 1962 style fifth grade profanity and for the scary scenes of " the beast . " my son jeffrey , age 8 , had mixed feeling about the movie . overall , he found the show was " kind of boring , kind of exciting , and kind of scary . " still i think kids around 9 and up will love the picture . even jeffrey wanted to go back and see his favorite parts again -- the swimming pool scene and the long ending . i recommend the film to you and give it * * * . i came close to awarding it even more . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : june 30 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
writer-director bernard rose is obviously more concerned with telling his version of the tale than in remaining anchored in reality . nevertheless , as the old saying goes , " don't let the facts stand in the way of a good story . " the question is : is immortal beloved solid drama ? ignoring a silly and melodramatic conclusion , the probable answer is " yes . " the movie is least satisfactory in the investigative sequences , combining a rather lackluster performance by krabbe with an implausible scenario . on the other hand , perhaps it's the absence of gary oldman's flamboyant beethoven that makes these sections of immortal beloved so flat . often , especially when the story slows , it's the lead actor's performance that keeps this film from devolving into a turgid mess . aside from oldman , the other really impressive element of immortal beloved is , as might be expected , the soundtrack . taking the composer's best-known pieces and stringing them together makes for a heady experience , especially when director rose marries the music with sufficiently impressive visual images ( the use of the ninth symphony's " ode to joy " is a memorable moment of cinematic poetry ) . ultimately , however , the film's biggest failing is its characterization of beethoven . not only is he shown to be a selfish , crabby , arrogant womanizer ( which is probably accurate ) , but we're rarely given more than a surface look into his personality . because we're forced to watch him from an emotional distance , it's difficult to generate much sympathy . by extension , the identity of beethoven's " immortal beloved " is less a great mystery than a minor curiosity . there are times when the script is unworthy of the subject matter , and occasions when oldman's co-stars ( especially marco hofschneider , who plays beethoven's nephew karl ) seem ill-suited to their roles . nevertheless , negatives aside , the plot holds the viewer's interest , even if it doesn't touch the heart . immortal beloved is the sort of flawed movie that still has enough assets to allow it to be enjoyed . 
the story revolves around relationships that look perfect but aren't , just like the bowl . carrying the bowl metaphor a bit further , this exquisite motion picture itself has a few imperfections , including being about 10 minutes too long . more disconcerting is jeremy northam's jarring italian accent which feels just as fake as his beard , which may be genuine but doesn't look it . still , these are minor quibbles . their movies always look terrific . sometimes , as in the room with a view , they let the look overwhelm the story , but other times , as in the remains of the day and the golden bowl , they come up with a story that's more than a match for the production's lush appearance . several decades ago , the bbc did a mini-series of " the golden bowl , " which was shown on masterpiece theater in america -- the prince , by the way , notes that he is a direct descendant of amerigo vespucci from whence the word america is derived . this television series is a personal favorite of mine , and , even if this film version doesn't quite measure up , it is a wonderful movie in its own right . bad idea . even after maggie knows of her husband's infidelity , she tells charlotte with something sounding like complete sincerity , " i have never thought you anything you but beautiful , wonderful and good . " one thing is certain , there are lots of truthfully good things to say about this superb motion picture from the strong ensemble cast to the striking production to the mesmerizing yet delicate story . the golden bowl runs 2 : 10 . it is rated r for a brief sex scene without nudity . the movie would be acceptable for kids around 12 or 13 and up . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
bruce paltrow's duets , a would-be comedy about competitive karaoke singing , is about as much fun to watch as a bad karaoke singer . actually , it's worse , since the karaoke singers in the film aren't bad enough to laugh at . instead , too many of them are so good that you wonder if they're lip-synching . with its low energy and its leaden script , the movie has almost nothing going for it except the presence of bruce's daughter gwyneth in the cast . watching the intelligent gwyneth paltrow trying to play a dumb character like liv is at best disconcerting and at worst embarrassing . about the only part of their routine that's memorable is liv's beatific smile . the movie's best on-going joke involves todd's inability to use any of his 800 , 000 frequent flyer miles . " it's a rush like you won't believe ! " replies one of its participants . one of the many problems with duets , besides being a comedy that's not funny , is that this " rush " is never present on the screen . the movie leaves us with one question . why did gwyneth paltrow agree to do this movie ? sometimes even parents have really bad ideas . duets runs 1 : 52 . it is rated r for language and some sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . 
let me warn everyone up front that this is a correctly rated nc-17 show that has wall-to-wall sex . the meantime between sex in this show is maybe three minutes . at the end of the review i want to discuss the demographics of the audience when i saw it . you can stop for a second and speculate now if you like before reading further . the director of this segment is lizzie borden . i think it is a * * * movie as it portrays a tragically sad but realistic view behind the scenes of a world few will ever see . in erotique , borden does the only good directing job , but her segment is still pretty boring in parts . the script ( lizzie borden and susie bright ) has some funny dialog , but mainly is lacking any real development . it is written and directed very poorly by monika treut . other than a funny bus scene there is little to recommend it . most of the action takes place in an expensive , but spartan apartment with almost no furniture . the script by eddie ling-ching fong is minimalist . the acting is pretty amateur . kamala lopez-dawson was the only really polished actor . for a movie about eroticism , i was surprised to find only the love making performance by hayley man to have any real passion . now for the demographics of the audience . i saw the show at a local art house that i go to a lot . i have never noticed any particular groups in attendance . erotique runs a little too long at 1 : 30 . there is tons of very graphic heterosexual and homosexual sex plus much discussion of all the possible words to use to describe sex . this is heavy nc-17 material and not appropriate for teenagers period . although i found several scenes i liked quite well , the rest of the movie was a vast wasteland to paraphrase newton minnow . i award the film * for the few good scenes , but do not recommend it . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
date released : 12/22/93 ( ny , la ) ; 1/14/94 ( elsewhere ) running length : 2 : 05 rated : pg-13 ( mature themes , language , brief nudity ) some will argue that a film , being essentially a means of entertainment , can do little to change a national consciousness . others , citing the power of the medium , will claim that motion pictures possess this rare and extraordinary ability . these two opposing viewpoints are about to be put to the test with two films that , while different in so many ways , have a number of fundamental similarities . the first is steven spielberg's schindler's list . for viewers of the latter movie , the question is not whether they sympathize with tom hanks' aids-afflicted , gay character , but whether that sympathy opens up a different perspective on the victims of the disease in the real world . the point has been made numerous times that this is the first " big name , big budget " aids motion picture to come out of hollywood , so i won't belabor the point . it's a good start , and some might argue " too little , too late , " but for there to be any hope of this industry having an impact , more films of this caliber must be released . philadelphia is unlikely to succeed as a lone cry in the wilderness , however impressive it may be . tom hanks gives what has rightly been called " the performance of his career , " lending humanity and vibrancy to the victim , and portraying him in a manner that eschews maudlin , obvious tactics to garner the audience's sympathy . we feel for andrew beckett because he seems to be a genuine human being , not because the script and production have twisted circumstances to manipulate our emotions . with all of the plaudits garnered by hanks , the work of denzel washington , while less obvious , is as impressive . washington plays the " everyman , " the on-screen representation of those in the audience who harbor homophobic tendencies . he , like many viewers , is forced to examine his bigotry , and reassess his feelings about the gay community , as he comes to know them as people rather than symbols and caricatures . its also ironic that most of philadelphia's humor comes through washington , the recognized dramatic actor ( as he passes out business cards ) , rather than through hanks , known better for comic roles . curiously , jason robards has one of the worst-acted and the best-acted scenes in the film . the entire speech rings false , like something out of an anti-homosexual pamphlet . this scene is philadelphia's watershed . unfortunately , there are too few of these moments , with an inordinate amount of time spent in front of the judge . philadelphia doesn't work well as a courtroom drama--some of the scenes are necessary to underline certain points , but they go on too long . more character development , especially involving the complex relationship between beckett and miller , would have elevated the picture's power . symbolism is crucial to the story ; the most obvious example is the role of physical space between beckett and miller . philadelphia was originally the movie's working name , but demme stated that once he saw the preliminary cut , he couldn't think of a better final title . even as it stands , with its faults , philadelphia is still a remarkable expression of honesty and openness . miller's court statements about this country's fear of homosexuals are frank and to-the-point , and there are other observations with equal merit . the story is timely and powerful , and the performances of hanks and washington assure that the characters will not immediately vanish into obscurity . and as long as people remember , there's a chance they can change . 
as dave berry would say , " i am not making this up . " although adults may be bored stiff by the confusing story and find the outfits laughable , the film will undoubtedly find an eager audience with the grade school group . the film starts off strongly with a highly imaginative kung fu sequence inside the kitchen of a chinese restaurant . peter pau's cinematography is stunning throughout the film , especially during the food photography . the images remind one of like water for chocolate . a lavish food scene of sumptuous beauty is the last thing one expects in a kids' movie , especially a magical , superhero one . this one appears as though lifted out of a metropolitan opera production . the less said about macfadyen's atrocious acting , the better . both are in strong contrast to the dull forest colors on the rest of the actors . elysia gives ryan a 30-second explanation of the characters and their places in his new environment , but it makes about as much sense as flipping through the cliff's notes version of " war and peace . " eventually , the story comes together somewhat , but the confusion remains . it feels like you are watching the twenty-fourth episode of a dungeons and dragons series , where you missed the first twenty-three episodes . as an adult , there is only one way to survive the film -- crank your brain down to third grade level . ignoring the silly plot and funny rubber heads , you can begin to appreciate the majesty of the rest of the production . in both films , the sets are the most impressive parts of the movie . a tad too dark for the preschool set , but beautiful nevertheless . he and the director of photography clearly worked together closely on the effect they wanted to create . the film is at its most magical in the choreographing of the fight sequences . finally , i must comment at length on the pg rating of the film , which i fear may be too lenient . there is a single bad cuss word in the film , and it is used effectively for humor in one of the movie's best lines . still , it is just the sort of inappropriate phrase that your kid will repeat endlessly . the film has several open mouth kissing scenes , where the kisses are carefully aborted just before the lips and tongues touch . the biggest problem comes in several violent scenes which would have worked just as well without the blood . if you make the mistake of taking kids younger than seven , they may repeat ryan's plea : " i don't want to be here anymore . i don't want to see death . i just want to go home . " it is rated pg . the film's target audience is the grade school crowd . the beauty of the production convinced me to give the picture thumbs up and * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
and when sandler says anything , it means exactly that . do anything you want without any regard to whether it hurts you or others . it doesn't . the movie shamelessly tries to shock you -- from the unexpected , big gay kiss to the vomit scene so realistic that you can see the exact contents of julian's most recent meal . the sadistic movie has sonny showing julian how to have fun by tripping speeding rollerbladers with a stick . in the movie's signature comedy routine , sonny teaches julian how to urinate in public . the movie's most egregious action has sonny taking julian for a late morning breakfast at mcdonald's . if you don't get exactly what you want in life , when you want it , the movie wants us to feel empowered to demean those who've had the bad luck to cross our paths . the humor generally is on the level of laughing about whether julian can wipe his own rear . some jokes are funny , even if barely . " what is it ? " the movie , which celebrates bad behavior , will undoubtedly have audiences composed largely of 9-14 year olds , as was ours . the marketing of the movie is clearly aimed at that group . the tearjerker ending tries to eradicate the teachings of the rest of the movie with a big message that you should call your father up and tell him that you love him . it doesn't fly . nice sentiment , but much too late . it is rated pg-13 for language and some crude humor . the film is acceptable for teenagers but questionable for those much younger . my son jeffrey , age 10 , loved the film and gave it * * * 1/2 , saying it really cracked him up . except for the throwing up and spitting , he liked it all . 
that notion explains a lot about how the film incarnation of leave it to beaver ended up as it did . i don't remember ward as a well-intentioned but emotionally immature doofus . the central character of leave it to beaver isn't really theodore " beaver " cleaver ( newcomer cameron finley ) , or his older brother wally ( erik von detten ) , and certainly not june ( janine turner ) . he's too busy damaging the lad's self-esteem by creating unrealistic expectations and appearing judgmental . and it's too bad , because there's a silly , innocent quality to leave it to beaver which makes it better than you'd expect from yet another tv retread . the comedy comes from the kind of predictably broad slapstick common in most contemporary comedies for kids , but it's blessedly free of toilet gags and exaggerated mayhem . brian levant and lon diamond's script ( levant worked on the syndicated " the new leave it to beaver " series in the 80s ) is often surprisingly clever , and even more surprisingly clean . the performances are sit-com simple yet mostly appealing , particularly that of the agreeably adorable cameron finley . it's obvious that leave it to beaver isn't meant to court the nostalgia audience , unless it is through the inclusion of barbara billingsley ( the original june ) and ken osmond ( the original eddie haskell ) in cameos . those viewers might actually enjoy seeing the cleavers portrayed as a healthy and happy family , rather than just another dysfunction waiting to happen . this leave it to beaver is unabashedly 90s in a fairly depressing way : it takes paternal incompetence as a given . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
those expecting this to be an unapologetically silly movie are right on the money . however , as idiotic as it is , my boyfriend's back is not without a few redeeming qualities . much like last year's buffy the vampire slayer , there are enough clever touches to the film to keep it from becoming tedious or unwatchable . i would never argue that my boyfriend's back is a good movie , nor would i recommend it to anyone , but it's not nearly as awful as the title would suggest , and there are at least a few worse pictures available at the moment . one of the primary problems with this film is that while it has a fun , lighthearted tone , it isn't nearly funny enough . far too many jokes fall flat , and those that do succeed are more likely to provoke an amused smirk than any genuine laughter . the premise is somewhat underused , at least as far as humor goes . my boyfriend's back is pretty good at self-parody , though . the nonchalant way that everyone treats johnny's return is clever and enjoyable to watch . nothing that happens seems to shock anyone ; they take it all in stride . there is an anti-racist , anti-prejudice message that doesn't work . i recognize that the people behind my boyfriend's back are trying to do something positive , but comparing the plight of the undead--a truly ridiculous situation to begin with--to the bigotry faced by many minorities is more than just a bad idea ; it's insensitive . i can even see where some might find it downright offensive . it's surprising how good the cast is . they do their jobs in the right spirit , giving excellent , deadpan ( no pun intended ) performances that keep this film from going into cardiac arrest . how fine actors like mary beth hurt and edward herrmann can keep straight faces through these proceedings is difficult to conceive . one inventive touch found in the movie serves to emphasize the comic-book quality of the story . many of the scenes are started with cartoon panels that turn into live-action sequences . director bob balaban has fun blending fantasy , comedy , and parody together , and does a surprisingly smooth job of it . if only his script had more bite , this could have been a worthwhile film . as it is , my boyfriend's back is about as mindless as a movie can get . that's not always a bad thing to say about a film , but it certainly isn't an heartfelt endorsement . maybe when it comes on cable , it will be worth a look--that's about the right medium for something of this sort . my boyfriend's back has its moments , just not enough of them . this review is copyright 1993 by james berardinelli 
stop me if you've heard this one before . okay , so you've heard more permutations of this story that you can count . second-time director david hubbard , whose first offering was the abysmal trippin' , makes a more satisfying , if not very original , film this time -- a teenage romantic comedy called whatever it takes . although it has all of the requisite bathroom humor and underage drinking that i'm sorry to say that many teens want in their movies , it also has some good messages about the consequences of your actions and has some likable leads . it certainly isn't anything memorable , but it's a slightly above the average member of its genre . the movie tries to make you believe that he only has the former . maggie , of course , is the biggest knockout in the movie with a killer body and an electric smile that would light up broadway . he'd no sooner have romantic intentions for her that he would for a sibling . well , you get the idea . needless to say , all four of them will be surprised with the results . when an awkward ryan tries to shake ashley's hand rather than kiss her at the end of their double date , schwahn manages to have her surprise us . similarly , the story's ending contains a well deserved , albeit a bit sadistic , comeuppance . so does the movie end in a prom ? as teenagers would say , " well , duh ! " talk about telegraphing your punches . when the predictable movie ends , what you're likely to remember , however , aren't its flaws , of which there are many , but maggie and ryan . they are two adorable characters who win your hearts even if the rest of the picture doesn't . it is rated pg-13 for thematic elements , sexual material and language . the movie would be acceptable for teenagers , preferably older ones . 
it is a comedy/documentary/horror movie . i smiled from the opening credits where they told you it was a true story till the last credit where they reassured you that " no flies were injured or killed in the making of the film . " whew ! i was worried until those ending credits . i never laughed out loud , but i kept a constant grin on my face from ear to ear . remember ozzie and harriet ? well , this time harriet is cuter than ever , but she is a serial killer . looking at this family , it was hard not wanting to be a part of it . you had to keep reminding yourself that no matter how sweet the mom seemed , she was a serial killer after all . great cameo roles too by suzanne thighmasters summers and patty lets-rob-a-bank hearst . the movie was filmed in bright lights and vivid primary colors by robert stevens and robert m . stevens . the music by basil poledouris was continual sweetness and happiness . it really set the tone well . equal to turner's performance was john waters's direction . i have seen none of these and had it not been for the wonderful trailers i saw ahead of time , i think i never would have seen serial mom because i hate slap stick comedy , but this was a highly controlled comedy - certainly not slap stick . okay , so what is wrong with it ? it was way overboard too gory . other than that , which cost the movie a half star in my ratings , i found no other faults . waters does exactly what he sets out to do , and turner delivers a terrific performance . less cuteness and bigger laughs would have help get it another 1/2 star from me . the sight gags made you smile , but the dialog rarely elicited laughter . it is rate r for the intense gore . teenagers can probably handle the movie fine . i rate it * * 1/2 and recommend you see it but be prepared to look away when during the bloody scenes . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
the " die hard formula " rears its head several times each year , sometimes with great success ( speed ) , but more often as a miserable failure ( under siege 2 ) . sudden death , a die hard meets black sunday action flick with jean-claude van damme playing the hero , falls squarely in the latter category . admittedly , any die hard clone is going to demand a heavy dose of the ever-popular " suspension of disbelief " . however , there's a significant difference between accepting a few contrived plot devices and being asked to swallow a storyline that is utterly preposterous and implausible . nothing in sudden death makes any sense , and there are times when the action is so outlandish that the film moves into the realm of self-parody . about the best thing that can be said about this movie is that the action scenes , directed by peter hyams ( outland ) , are choreographed with flair . unfortunately , the material connecting them is worthless . if this seems like the scene from the naked gun where leslie nielsen impersonates an umpire , it's probably just a coincidence , although both films have about the same level of believabilty in these instances . hard as it may be to accept , van damme has finally found a cast that acts on his guttural level . powers boothe looks as if he could care less about the role , and appears content to do the absolute minimum to cash his check . he's neither sinister nor menacing , and doesn't offer a single biting one-liner . the young actors playing van damme's children are awful and raymond j . barry's vice president is a walking , talking cliche . there's nothing interesting about any of these characters , and no real reason to care whether they live or die . for a movie trying to build suspense through the dynamics of character relationships , that's a fatal flaw . simply put , sudden death is a bad movie . although not quite as unwatchable as two of this year's similar entries -- money train and under siege 2 -- the film has virtually nothing to recommend it to anyone who allows their brain to continue functioning while in the audience . deriving shallow enjoyment from sudden death's poorly-acted , extravagantly absurd series of predictable action sequences demands one of three characteristics : an irrational fondness for van damme , a love of stale , artless films , or an unhealthy tendency towards masochistic experiences . 
starring : whoopi goldberg , mary-louise parker , drew barrymore . screenplay : don roos . i have nothing against that ever-growing sub-genre of american filmmaking known as the " chick flick ; " however , i do have a problem with the idea that women will flock to any slapdash attempt at a sob story , any muddled mess which happens to include female friends , mothers and daughters and truckloads of tragedy . hollywood knows a lot about how to market films to women , but it has done a pretty miserable job of making them . fortunately , boys on the side is that rare creation , an emotional film that actually takes the time to develop characters , although it goes a bit overboard in its third act . the first half of boys on the side is surprisingly funny and effective , thanks largely to three winning performances by goldberg , parker and barrymore . goldberg has coasted quite a bit lately , playing the same hipper-than-thou character with a perpetual furrow in her brow as she deals with dopey white folks , but she is quite good here . parker is a more subtle actress , and she has to be in a role that easily could have become a fussy stereotype ; instead , robin is an extremely sympathetic and appealing character . boys on the side is very funny , but there is more to it than that . in one early scene , robin sprays disinfectant on jane's headphones before using them , and goldberg gives us a " you've got to be kidding " reaction shot . but that moment takes on a different resonance when it is revealed that robin has aids , and might be taking basic precautions . similarly , it is a surprise when jane refuses to hold robin's hand after learning of her illness , since we expect a nearly divine level of understanding from gay characters , but that moment is complicated by the realization that jane might be falling for robin , and that pulling away is just a way of expressing her fear of those emotions . there are numerous surprises like that , both funny and touching , throughout the first half of boys on the side , but the second half is much more uneven . once the women stop in tuscon , much of the film's energy stops with them , and humor inevitably gives way to bathos . most frustrating is a murder sub-plot , which is largely unnecessary and symptomatic of screenwriter don roos' tendency to pile far too much into far too little time . this is a film about the friendships between these three women , and it seriously falters when those friendships are not the focus of the story . when they are the focus , boys on the side does exactly what it sets out to do : it makes you laugh , it makes you sad , and it makes you care . 
if you thought how wonderful it would be living in new zealand a hundred years ago , this movie will disabuse you of that notion . this is a dark and depressing show about the evils of life . depressing shows can be quite rewarding as this film proves . holly hunter without her southern or any accent ( she does not talk ) nevertheless gives an award winning performance . her best for me will always be broadcast news . he was mean yet somehow you managed to feel sorry for him at times because he just did not seem to have the brains to know better . harvey keitel was excellent as the , well , as the boy friend i guess you might say . i wish they had ended the show in a slightly different way a few minutes before it actually ended . if you see the show , you will know where i mean . do go see it , but don't expect sweetness and light . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
suspect ( 1987 ) is an involving film , but one that is peppered with actions that are either implausible or at least highly improbable . if your ability to suspend disbelief is strong , you will probably find yourself enjoying some of the courtroom drama and thriller aspects of the film - numerous flaws and all . none of the acting is great , but it is fairly compelling , and director peter yates ( from the run of the country ) knows how to make entertaining films . sure . yes , this show is quite predictable . if a hollywood screenwriter makes a point of labeling someone a republican , the wardrobe department might as well have him wear a black hat through the rest of the picture . the music by michael kamen is sappy . whenever the director needs extra tension , and eric roth's script can't provide enough , yates turns to the composer to crack up the violins . actually , the script gets almost laughable at points . after complaining about not seeing a movie in a year and not being able to have a kid because she is too busy to date , riley laments , " i spend all of my day with murders and rapists , and what's really crazy , i like them . " even with the ridiculous script , i managed somehow to like the performances by cher and quaid . as for neeson , this is one of my least favorite of his films . his performance in it does nothing for me . i could probably write an article just on the flaws of the show . among those not already mentioned are the fact that riley somehow immediately knows that anderson is left-handed . since he doesn't read lips and can't hear , this makes it a little difficult . a fun show to watch in parts , but one where they feel the audience is not smart enough to see through all of the ridiculous contrivances in the plot . it is rated r for some violence and a little bad language . it would be fine for any teenager and maybe kids a bit younger . this is a somewhat enjoyable but frustrating show where there are just too many unbelievable parts for me to be able to recommend it . i give it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
this is not a sentimental film neither is it ever manipulative . it records the history in a stark , but effective and factual retelling . in this more complete rendition , anne comes alive as much more human and her death even more tragic . the story is told chronologically , and there is as much time devoted to the periods before and after the diary as to the diary period itself . the great shakespearean actor and director kenneth branagh does the narration . he delivers his lines with little emotion , but much impact . this is one of many passages in the film that speaks to all of us today . do we really know our kids ? anne comes alive in the film as a energetic girl who was somewhat of the class clown . anne confides in one section that , " they keep telling me i should talk less and mind my own business , but i seemed doomed to failure . " i have to be my own mother . " the initial publication of anne's diary had little impact , but eventually its fame grew , and it was translated into hundreds of languages and made into a play and then into many different movies , the first and most famous movie version being george stevens's 1959 one . there is actually little to see there and yet , no one will leave the place untouched . this movie will stay with me as it will anyone lucky enough to see it . a brilliant piece of cinematic art , and one incredible story . this review has only barely touched the surface of all that is revealed in the film . even if you think you know it all , this film will be a revelation to you . anne frank remembered runs a fast 2 : 02 , and i would not want a minute of it cut . the film is rated pg because of the horrors it discusses . there is little of the emaciated or dying people in concentration camp scenes so i think there is not much visually to shock young viewers . any kid old enough to consider the subject matter could see the film , and my guess is that means anyone over 8 . i give this film my strongest recommendation possible , and i believe the world would be a better place if everyone saw it . i give it * * * * for being a perfect movie . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
not surprisingly , leroy turns out to have a sensitive side , which sam loves nurturing . you name it . perhaps the best part of this quirky tale is the old , sepia-tone , speeded-up footage showing us the history behind the gun . the elaborately crafted gun was made long ago for the hand of a nobleman . we learn not one version of his legendary story but many . jerry , however , doesn't have time to appreciate the weapon's background . the actors , on the other hand , all appear to be having a great time . and if you were worried , as i was , that the director wouldn't be able to make the transition from his first film , mouse hunt , a dark kids' comedy , to a second one aimed squarely at a more adult audience , don't . this film is much better than mouse hunt . and , let's face it , the mexican is an explosive movie -- exploding with star power . pitt , roberts and gandolfini prove to be a thoroughly enjoyable , crowd pleasing combination . it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for most teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
some people like pauly shore ( mostly teenagers , i suspect ) . after all , if those people didn't exist , son-in-law would have never been made . clearly , the role of crawl was scripted specifically for him . oddly enough , with someone marginally less annoying , this could have been a somewhat charming , albeit predictable , film . there are times when it almost works , but most of those occasions are when he abandons his stupid stage personae and does something that approaches acting . unfortunately , there are too few of those moments and , as soon as they pass , the aggravating side of mr . shore quickly re-surfaces . there are times when it becomes exceptionally difficult to accept--not to mention like--the character of crawl . the film has its humorous scenes , but these are formula-driven and lacking in originality . perhaps the most inventive moment of son-in-law comes as the result of a cameo by brenden frasier , reprising the role he played in last summer's dud , encino man . it says something about the rest of this film to site that as one of son-in-law's highlights . the plot is stock romantic comedy material , complete with the usual misunderstandings , break-ups , and resolutions . the ending of son-in-law is so sickeningly sweet that i almost went into sugar shock . this gives an entirely new meaning to the term " happy ending . " blech . i'm not against happy endings in general , but this kind of sappiness is impossible to stomach . carla gugino , who has the somewhat thankless role of rebecca , does a fine job with the material she's been given . both have a certain freshness that's enjoyable to watch . this is especially true of gugino in this film , where she mercifully gives us a stable counterbalance to shore's idiotic antics . since son-in-law takes place on a farm , there exists the usual run of city-boy-out-of-his-element gags . it's all pretty routine stuff . the few laughs garnered by this line of tried-and-true humor aren't worth sitting through ninety-five minutes of lame drivel . son-in-law is a singularly unexceptional comedy , the content of which is well-represented by the theater trailers and tv ads . it's perfect fare for watching on cable , but not worth the time or effort of making a trip to a theater . those who can't stand pauly shore would do well to stay away , and those that love him will go regardless of what i say . so , for those who don't care one way or another , be aware that son-in-law gives exactly what you expect : a dumb , predictable romantic comedy that has more animals than laughs . 
everyone i know from my friends to siskel and ebert have gone bananas over forrest gump . i saw it , and i was extremely disappointed . from big to philadelphia , i have seen and loved almost all of tom hanks's movies . in a nutshell , i found this one to be a long bore . i checked my watch frequently and got sleepy by the end of the movie although we went to the 5 : 30 showing . forrest gump is about a boy with a marginal iq . the good parts of the movie are all technical . gump manages personally to see numerous presidents and other historical figures . you will be amazed at how well the special effects work . the best , and only good performance in the movie , is hanks . his performance was amazing , but at times it was too mechanical - almost an automaton . this was the second central figure in the movie , and wright was a weak actress who gave no life to the part . why did they feel they had to have forrest switch to a totally different amazing feat every 10 minutes ? why not develop some aspects more ? it was almost like it was written by a committee and everybody got to write 10 minutes of the story . most of all , why didn't the director have people that were real and that you cared about more ? all were way too mechanical for my taste . i should point out that almost everyone disagrees with me although janet maslin of the n . y . times was not impress by the show so at least i am not totally alone . there was lots of crying in the theater hence one of the reasons it is making zillions at the box office . forrest gump is rated pg-13 for violence , a little nudity , discussions of sexual incest , battle carnage , etc . i saw many many grade school kids in the audience . frankly , i think that was a mistake . teenagers , fine , but this not a kids ( preteen ) stuff movie no matter how cute the previews may look . i give the film * 1/2 for technical merit and do not recommend it . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
in reality , the only amazing thing about this motion picture is jack n . green's impressive camerawork , which constantly allows the scenery to upstage both two and four-legged performers . as a family film , the amazing panda adventure is more-than-suitable . it's reasonably entertaining with some not-so-bad acting , energetic action sequences , and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was scripted for ( or by ) morons . children will be enraptured by the cute animals and adults won't be put off by unbearable doses of treacle . despite the happy ending , this film doesn't go overboard when it comes to cute bonding scenes . they're there , to be sure , but they don't take up 50% of the screen time . taken as light fare , this movie succeeds . the best scenes , as might be expected , are those that highlight the pandas . attempts at human character building vary from marginal to dumb . fortunately , these demand minimal screen time . in contrast to the apes from congo , these animals look legitimate from start to finish , and it's impossible to tell the real pandas from their fake counterparts . occasionally , the amazing panda adventure stabs at serious issues , such as protecting endangered species and respecting other cultures , but director christopher cain seems primarily interested in telling this adventure yarn without cluttering the screen with " extraneous " matters . as a result , an opportunity to do something a little more substantial may have been missed . then again , substance isn't the strength of the amazing panda adventure , while sweeping vistas and furry animals are . theatrically , the amazing panda adventure has been packaged with a bugs bunny/daffy duck cartoon , " carrotblanca . " despite its attempts to parody the classic film casablanca , this turns out to be one of the most unimaginative , unamusing warner brothers cartoons in decades . outside of tweety bird's peter lorre impersonation , it's a waste of 8 minutes . apparently , if you want to see good bugs bunny , you have to stick to tv . 
although mary reilly is being billed as a remake of the dr . jekyll and mr . hyde story , i believe it is actually a remake of my fair lady . i can easily imagine professor higgins bolding proclaiming that he could take a famous story full of action and imagination , populate it with megastars , turn it into a colossal bore and yet so stun the audience with his audacity that no one would leave . everyone would know the story and the stars so they would wait until the last moment to realize that he had transformed a prince of a movie into a guttersnipe and that nothing of interest was ever going to happen in the film . as the audience leaves dazed and bewildered , colonel pickering must have been singing , " you've done it , you've done it , i can't believe you've done it . " the movie starts off promisingly enough with realistic gas and candle lit photography ( philippe rousselot ) . this , however , rapidly degenerates into a movie so dark and with such low contrast that your eyes , when you can keep them awake , will literally hurt from squinting so much trying to make out the action , or usually lack thereof , on the screen . the movie is filmed in edinburgh , but it is so dark , you'd never know it . most of the time , during this and all parts of the movie , is devoted to atmospheric scenes of one cast member or another slowly walking through rooms where little happens . it is hard to believe that this movie shares the same lineage with the numerous other dr . jekyll and mr . hyde pictures . in a failed attempt to solve this problem he comes up with lots of gratuitous violence and major amounts of human and animal blood . actually , my distaste for the movie comes not from disliking these scenes , but from being put to sleep by the boredom of the show . for some reason dr . jekyll looks a lot like ethan hawke in before sunrise . sure . the acting by the three great stars is an embarrassment . glenn close has no idea of what to do with her role and plays it like a stone . julia roberts seems to think that so long as she is made up to appear unattractive , and she grimaces a lot , she has achieved great art . last , and certainly least , is john malkovich's disappointing performance . i would list him close to the top of the best actors working today . in good shows and bad , i have been nothing less than in awe of his work until now . somehow , professor higgins , i mean stephen frears manages to get an uninteresting performance out of malkovich . this is a miracle i did not think possible . many scenes of no interest in the less are left in the final cut . although there is no sex , nudity , or bad language , there is so much gore that the movie is correctly rated r . although it might bore them to death , i do not think the movie would be bad for teenagers . on the other hand , i had trouble staying awake , and i wish i would have walked out so i do not recommend this extremely s-l-o-w film to anyone . rent any of the previous versions instead . i give the movie 1/2 of a * only because i've seen worse . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
date released : varies running length : 1 : 35 rated : no mpaa rating ( violence , language , sexual situations ) the themes of identity and individuality , as brought to the fore by amnesia , have been a staple of thrillers since the inception of the genre . the success of an effort dependent upon this worn-out tactic usually is a function of the talent of the director and the intelligence of the screenplay . dead again , brilliantly realized by kenneth branagh , is an example of one such movie that works . conversely , suture , the product of scott mcgehee and david siegel , is an unmitigated disaster . everyone in the movie comments on this , including the two principals . it's like looking in the mirror , they say . there's a problem , though , and it comes as a result of the audience's perception of all this , for while actor haysbert is a big , bulky african american , harris is tall , thin , and white . only danny devito and arnold schwarzenegger could be less alike . the producers/directors/writers are obviously having a great deal of fun with this , but it undermines their movie . by nature , thrillers demand suspension of disbelief , and this gimmicky device on the part of mcgehee and siegel destroys any hope of drawing an audience into the black-and- white world of their film . the audience becomes alienated and annoyed , and desperately wants someone to say " hey ! obviously , it never happens . some will probably find this conceit to be clever and artsy , but in my opinion , it's just plain stupid . the plot itself is relatively sparse and unoriginal . but vincent is still out there , somewhere , with a few loose ends to tie up . excepting the first and last fifteen minutes , this is a dull motion picture . it's admittedly stylish--the black-and-white photography has something to do with that--but the substance has been stretched and padded to reach feature length . there's a lot of fancy psychological talk about what it means to be true to one's identity , but it all amounts to very little . in the end , no one's likely to remember any of it . i certainly don't . the acting isn't all that remarkable . only michael harris as the creepy , detached vincent , gives a reasonable performance , and his won't be remembered among the great villains of the genre . none of the characters are of much interest to the audience , nor apparently to the men and women playing them . in its conception , suture was probably designed more as an homage to hitchcock than a completely original piece . what creators mcgehee and siegel have forgotten is that to honor a great filmmaker , it's necessary to come up with something worth watching . after suture , they should keep looking , because they haven't found it yet . maybe next time they'll try something with sisters . . . 
i have mixed feelings about geronimo : an american legend . we had a lot of shots of geronimo staring christ-like into the lens for long periods without moving . wes studi who plays geronimo , and who was great in last of the mohicans , convinces you of geronimo's near godliness . the picture makes you feel how he has been wronged and since he is a warrior , murdering people is the natural thing that all warriors must do . i read an article where wes studi said he felt the movie tried too hard to be politically correct . if you want to see a really good movie about native americans , i recommend dances with wolves . last of the mohicans is also good albeit not in the same league as dances with wolves . so what was right about the show ? excellent performances by all of the actors . especially fascinating was wes studi and jason patric . good minor character roles were played by gene hackman and robert duvall . the cinematography by lloyd ahern was award winning quality with great open space shots and very effective close up shadow shots . given the violence , i am surprised it did not get an r . it would be fine for teenagers . overall , i think the good does outweigh the bad , and i give the show a thumbs up and * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
academy award winning actor kevin spacey is easily one of the most interesting actors working in film today . never to be taken for granted , he brings a cool unpredictability to any part he plays . in the negotiator his cherubic face masks an intelligence and intensity that makes his character completely captivating . it's never clear what his next move will be . " you have no idea what i am capable of . " no kidding . director f . gary gray's taut thriller starts with a formulaic approach , but soon takes some major side turns . from beginning to end , the well-executed film has the audience on the edge of their seats . although there are some bad plot choices , as when one character's bravado turns almost suicidal , the story is a well-developed and intelligent mystery about police corruption . with plenty of action to keep the adrenaline pumping but not so much as to overwhelm the psychological drama at the heart of the story , the movie strikes just the right balance . the brightly written script by james demonaco and kevin fox mixes in just enough humor without transforming the tone of the picture . it assumes the audience has enough intelligence to see some obvious ruses even before most of the characters in the drama realize what is happening . j . t . walsh , who specialized in portraying characters with shady reputations , is perfect for the part . as good as jackson is as the story's central character , spacey is even better . chris and danny go into a beautifully scripted series of negotiations . danny is the funniest , but chris is the most surprising . suffice it to say that you wouldn't want to play cards with either of them . russell carpenter , titanic's academy award winning cinematographer , gives a fast-paced energy to the picture's look . using fast moving close-ups , slow motion , and a few cuts to black and white , he gives the movie a gritty intimacy . the engrossing movie has a strong supporting cast that includes david morse , ron rifkin , and john spencer among others . the test of a mystery and an action thriller is how well the writers can bring the story to a conclusion . the negotiator has some well thought through ending surprises that are completely plausible and fascinating to watch unfold . if a film has kevin spacey in it , you will not be disappointed . even if spacey should find his way into a bad movie , his part will be well worth seeing . the negotiator runs a little too long at 2 : 15 . it is rated r for violence and profanity and would be fine for most teenagers . 
actually , that isn't even close to the worst . the reality is much more horrific . hers is the only performance in i know what you did last summer with any depth . in a scene lifted straight out of scream -- they share the same screenwriter , kevin williamson -- the kids try to out-scare each other with diabolical stories . to their credit , their story telling has more intensity that the movie itself . it is in this sequence that the four actors come most alive . in the rest of the film their parts are relegated to caricature . the story alternates between a traditional slasher film and a whodunit . john debney's heavy music overwhelms every scene with reminders to be frightened . a few more surprises would have been welcome in this putative horror show . the very last scene of the film , although the most predictable , manages to be the scariest . although a handsome film , thanks to denis crossan's cinematography , i know what you did last summer is a goose-bumps-free horror show with little fresh material and nothing to recommend its viewing . i know what you did last summer runs 1 : 40 . it is rated r for profanity and gory violence including people being gutted with a hook . the show would be fine for teenagers used to such horror pictures . i give this one thumbs down and * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : october 15 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
pretty boy josh hartnett , last seen unimpressively in pearl harbor , delivers an even more underwhelming performance in tim blake nelson's o . first-time screenwriter brad kaaya's script for o is very loosely based on shakespeare's othello . mekhi phifer ( i still know what you did last summer ) plays the team's star , odin james , and hartnett is the team's very jealous , utility player , hugo goulding . nelson has all of his actors speaking in whispers . this risky technique can work , as it did spectacularly in the deep end , but with actors more interested in posing than working , the effect is sleep inducing . sheen , to his credit , does chew up the scenery in a hopeless attempt to wake up the sleepy production . the very preppy , southern school -- both sexes are required to wear blazers and ties -- has only one black , odin , a kid of fairly average height who appears nba bound . having one lone black allows the screenwriter to throw in a bunch of clich ? d racial lines . although it contains one of the most unconvincingly staged murders in recent memory , the last act does breathe some needed life into an otherwise s-l-o-w movie . it is rated r for violence , a scene of strong sexuality , language and drug use and would be acceptable for most teenagers . in the silicon valley , it will be playing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
will the real howard stern please stand up ? for , in truth , the man who haunts the airwaves of nearly three-dozen radio stations each morning seems vastly different from the kinder , milder version who graces the screen in betty thomas' sweet , often-hilarious biopic . along the way , we get to know howard as a tender , intelligent , affable guy who just happens to do an " offensive . . . obnoxious . . . so who is howard stern , really ? is he private parts' gentle soul with a loud mouth , or is he just the loud mouth ? actually , it doesn't make much difference ; the truth about stern's nature doesn't alter the fact that private parts is an entertaining motion picture . as astonishing as it may be for his fans to acknowledge , howard stern is not a universally-known personality . and there's no overseas outlet . however , while these scenes offer a flavor of what stern's program is like , they don't really capture the true " feel " , which is harsher , edgier , and more prone to offend . in fact , there are numerous times when private parts seems to pull its punches rather than letting them fly without concern for the consequences . the battles with the fcc have been relegated to a minor annoyance ( this isn't a first amendment " message movie " like the people vs . it will probably come as no surprise to stern fans to learn that their hero has an undeniable screen presence . unlike many personalities-turned-actors , he never seems awkward or out-of-place . stern's surprisingly subdued portrayal of himself may open a few eyes , however . as for howard's most prominent real-life-turned-reel- life associates -- while quivers and norris are unlikely to win oscars for their work here , they don't embarrass themselves , either . private parts is aimed primarily at a mainstream audience . the humor here is racy , but also universal , and many of the jokes will cause viewers to double over with laughter ( like the dig at the academy awards during the end credits ) . and , as bizarre as it may sound , stern is the kind of guy you can't help pulling for . the question hanging over private parts' financial success is whether enough non-stern fans will venture to see what they may view as a " cult " or " niche " film . 
here's a helpful hint for would-be filmmakers that i offer free of charge . if you're dead set on ripping off the funniest movies of the previous year ( there's something about mary ) , make sure that your film's opening sequence has at least some humorous aspect . to be fair , there is much more wrong with the picture than pollack's clumsy directing and the lame script by james b . cook , marc meeks and david spade . the picture allows you to admire her beauty but nothing more . mostly you feel sorry for her for getting stuck in such a bad movie . typical of the story's recycled humor is the oven that belches fires when opened . and then there are the flatulence jokes . it plays just as badly as it sounds . this movie is more likely to elicit groans than laughs . the movie features a stream of dog abuse jokes . supposedly , someone will find such humor funny . the movie isn't a complete waste as we get tidbits of dylan's philosophy . we also get a putdown line that i'm sure you guys will want to include in your mental bag of tricks . that's sure put your ex-girlfriend in her place . lost & found continues the recent trend of bad movies whose only decent segments occur during the closing credits . as the credits roll , the actors ham it up as they dance to an energetic rock beat . this two-minute music video is the only portion of the movie worth seeing . it is rated pg-13 for crude humor , sexuality , brief nudity and profanity and would be fine for teenagers . 
the secret garden has at least two things going for it : remarkable acting and mesmerizing cinematography ( by roger deakins ) . even without much of a story , this film could stand alone on those two qualities . and maberly isn't all sugar-and-spice . her mary has plenty of bitterness , disdain , and arrogance to make her virtually unbearable at times . maggie smith , always the consummate professional , is excellent as the nasty housekeeper . mrs . medlock isn't all bad , however , even though her few moments of humanity could hardly be called heartwarming . ms . holland is an avowed fan of the story , having read it over and over again as a child . the care and effort she poured into this , her first hollywood effort , is proof enough of that . she has created a picture that is magical for viewers of all ages . colin is neither physically nor emotionally whole . the secret garden is a place of rare and wondrous beauty , and it becomes the emotional balm that heals all wounds , both physical and psychological . the secret garden combines drama , fantasy , and a little bit of light gothic horror ( the old house with its strange noises ) into a satisfying mix . the film is a visual feast , from the eerie insides of misselthwaite manor to the time-lapse photography of blooming flowers . zbigniew preisner's score adds to the atmosphere without ever becoming obvious or intrusive . i'm not sure how some younger viewers will react to this film . most of them will miss the subtle nuances that agnieszka holland brings to the screen ( which are aimed at adults ) , but the story , centering as it does around children , will be enough to captivate many . obviously , the secret garden is not an action film , and those weaned on that genre are likely to find this production stale . nevertheless , it is an excellent family film for those willing to immerse themselves in its leisurely pace--the picture proceeds just fast enough to keep the audience's attention while exhibiting a great attention to detail . the secret garden has something to offer everyone , and that's a rarity among movies these days . 
the director is ultimately asking the viewer to be the judge , as he seems too preoccupied with painting his canvas with a love that gets stuck somewhere between a lustful sexual romp and one of pathos . what results in an incomplete ending for a film that can't stand clarity except in its photography and its affection for the three flawed main characters ( alice , martin , and benjamin ) . the story seemed jarring at times , its inexorable rhythms and its lack of dialogue seemed out of place with the attempt made in tracking each character down in depth . yet the film seems to work best when it was in a state of murkiness . when things started clearing up and the characters become who we think they were , the big secret doesn't seem that surprising , but how it is handled seems bizarre though not fully credible , as it is perplexing why the main character is so concerned with finding out something about himself that will cause him so much pain when he doesn't have to . yet there is something about this film that is more than meets the eye , even though the film left me unsatisfied , it was still so well-crafted , that i found myself liking it better than i first thought i did . the film does not necessarily go in chronological order , thereby the flashbacks that come without order , are meant to give weight to the story as presented at the time , and will give this rather conventional unhappy family story line a feeling of much more mystery than is needed . but it's too melodramatic , the guilt motivation seems too illogical , and the half-baked psychology fails to explain its characters for it too fully work as drama . the actors were all sweating their lines to make it seem as if they had to dig deep to come up with a gem here and there , but their performances were all finely tuned and seemed to add to the film's need to have confusion be its guiding light . what keeps this film going , is the way it keeps the emotional pot boiling , and just when you are ready to give up on it as merely sitcom stuff , the film bounces back from its wordless silence and halting love dramatics to boil over with fits of liberating agony . there was no dialogue to explain why he's a fugitive or what's on his mind . she turns down this proposal , but with a look more of sadness than of love , she goes to him and says , " take me , i'm yours if you want me . " you have to stick with this one and not get too perturbed by the unsatisfying finale to see this one through and then , you might feel its emotional grip growing on you . it's a pure cinematic vehicle , where the pictures tell the story better than the story seems to be told . there was a strangely felt wry humor that underscored the dead serious mood the film had . alexis loret , in his debut film role , gives an interesting performance of someone who is always out of place no matter where he is . but , when it comes to the heavy romance , i didn't feel that this romance was as deep as portrayed . though the director might have implied it had more going for it than sexual gratification , i saw no other convincing reason for the romance . it could be asserted that maternal instincts , soul searching , and misplaced pathos on juliette's part were responsible for the romance , but i couldn't see any other reason but the libido . martin was just not a warm enough character to believe he could generate so much unconditional love . 
screenplay : dana stevens . director : michael apted . good thrillers are hard to find , and i am inordinately fond of good thrillers . in combination , these two factors lead me to do things like give an " 8 " rating to malice ( which i still defend , incidently ) . the catharsis that a suspenseful tale provides seems to me to be the essence of what movies are for many viewers : a visual rollercoaster . however , far more common than good thrillers are slapdash would-be scarefests stitched together from other better films like some celluloid frankenstein's monster . witness blink : one part rear window , two parts jennifer 8 , and one part from just about every suspense film cliche you could come up with if given a week to think about it . there are some things that blink tries to do differently that show some early promise . it's a nice bit of psychology for which i had high hopes . emma's distorted vision is captured by some nifty computer effects and dante spinotti's eerie photography , allowing us into her head quite effectively . it's too bad that potential is wasted on such a positively bland story . for a thriller , blink is almost completely lacking in tension , its one good scare coming with emma's first recognition of the killer's face . there's no opportunity to guess the killer's identity , either , as clues yeield a " so what " result . what is most distressing about that relationship is that it cops out on its character development where it would have been most interesting . stowe shows the blind emma as confident and independent , but without the omnipresent bitterness which characterizes so many blind screen characters ; then , in a bit of irony which might have made o . henry smile , she becomes dependent on others only when she can finally see . but screenwriter dana stevens seems incapable of that level of subtlety , and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their eventual ( and inevitable ) coupling , and subsequent conflict . it doesn't help that hallstrom is basically a blank , and that quinn does nothing to make him particularly worth her time . if only that were the only fault in the script . here , cops exchange dialogue like : blink could have been a contender . the elements were there . it was just too slow to make any of them count , and too timid to go to the soul of the characters . 
diabolique is a classic thriller and murder mystery that was made in 1954 , but while watching it i thought it was made in the 30s or 40s . it has the look and feel of one of the original hitchcock movies from the 30s . the original uncut version of the movie that is now showing has fresh looking and handsome black and white prints and has seven minutes of footage restored . i will set up the plot for you , but no more , since the twists in the movie are the main reason to see it . the other characters are unimportant and not worth mentioning . other than the fun script and all of the games it plays convincing you of one " fact " only to start making you think that just the opposite is true , the only other outstanding part of the movie is the cinematography . it transports you to france and to a time past . the feel of the countryside and of the little private school is at once both hokey and wonderfully evocative of a simpler era . the film maker is careful to focus in menacingly on the expressions on the characters faces when they are surprised or frighten--very hitchcockean . the problem i had with the film and the reason i did not rate it higher was the one dimensional acting . the husband was supposed to be the canonical cad , but i did not buy meurisse performance for a minute . he was totally unconvincing . signoret did an acceptable job of portraying a character who showed no emotion at all . the only interesting work was that of vera clouzot--wife of the director henri-georges clouzot . her performance had some depth , but still she was mainly a stick figure . her version of fear reminded me of a caricature of someone in acting 101 learning how to demonstrate fear . the movie runs about two hours . it is not rated but probably would get an r for the half dozen uses of the f word and the adult themes . there is no sex or nudity . the little violence it has is realistic , but not bloody or particularly frightening . it would be fine for any teenager to see . i recommend the picture for a fun and tricky plot and for the nostalgic filming , and i award * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : march 8 , 1995 opinions expressed are solely mine & not meant to reflect my employer's . 
screenplay : stanley tucci . director : stanley tucci . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 102 minutes . it has long been one of my most closely-held dramatic axioms that there is no middle ground when it comes to the execution of farce . either a writer and director get it , or they don't . if they get it , the result is exhilarating comic brilliance . if they don't get it , the result is nearly unendurable . and never , i believed , could the twain meet . another false dichotomy bites the dust . writer/director stanley tucci's the impostors is old-fashioned farce that floats along amusingly , yet only occasionally hits the high notes that turn chuckles into gut-busters . it's a classic screwball farce set-up , which tucci cleverly chooses to place in the classic screwball farce era of the 1930s . opening with a great bit of pantomime accompanying the opening credits , tucci establishes arthur and maurice as protagonists in the mold of the classic silent film comedians -- lovable losers , not above a bit of duplicity if it suits their purposes , yet ultimately heroic ( and , in particular , chivalric ) . the pre-shipboard scenes , though little more than isolated comedy sketches , do a nice job of showing the chemistry between the two . by the time the intercontinental hits the open sea , tucci and platt's starving , utterly sincere artistes have generated plenty of good will . i was ready for the impostors to soar once arthur and maurice began dashing from stateroom to stateroom ; instead , it levels off at a pleasant cruising altitude . tucci populates the ship with plenty of goofy characters -- a fascistic head steward ( campbell scott ) , a suicidal entertainer incongruously named happy ( steve buscemi ) , a wallflower heiress ( hope davis ) , a deposed monarch-in-hiding ( isabella rossellini ) -- clearly intended to make arthur and maurice look like the sane ones in a sea of chaos . yet he doesn't allow these characters to function in scenes that build comic momentum . tucci's gags are mostly of the hit-and-run variety . while there are a few admittedly hilarious ones , they seem like wasted opportunities to do what great farce does best : have each comic moment draw from the previous comic moment , and lead into the next comic moment , in a hysterically unstoppable domino effect . those missed opportunities are most evident when tucci _does_ allow a scene to build momentum . such fourth wall-breaking captures farce at its anything-for-a-laugh finest . more often , tucci goes for the gentle touch which worked so well in big night . as frisky and unpretentious a comedy as the impostors is , it traffics in an unnecessarily restrained level of lunacy . tucci's spin on monkey business has plenty of funny business , but it doesn't let anarchy reign quite as often as it should . it's that rarest of comedic animals : the merely-good farce . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
although not one of his better stories , the movie version accentuates its problems without highlighting its better portions . the difficulty in bringing le carre's novels to the screen is that his characters are by design all cold and unlikable . this requires great skill on the director's part to stage it in such a way that the story becomes compelling . arguably the only motivation to view the movie is the chance to catch anthony hopkins , whom his fans probably think was never young , playing in one of his first movie roles . his ragged acting lacks polish , but you can glimpse the beginning of his talent and charisma . the story spends most of its time in petty spy squabbles with little actual intrigue . the characters are little more than stick figures , and the performances are all shallow , even that of hopkins . the director seems incapable of composing a compelling scene . typical of the picture is the sequence in which john and leiser sit drunk in the rain and slowly draw pictures with chalk on the wet sidewalk . even the staging of the scene of leiser sneaking across the border under the barbed wire should have been filled with tension but instead we get little more than tedium . the film , mainly devoid of music , could have been helped greatly by more of it . the story's thesis seems to be that intelligence work is boring , but doing that without making the movie be so is a tricky proposition and a trap into which this movie sinks like quicksand . the picture is not rated but would be pg-13 for mature themes , implied sex , semi-nudity , and some violence and would be fine for kids around ten and up . 
u . s . availability : limited release spring 1995 running length : 1 : 33 mpaa classification : no rating ( mature themes ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 cast : alia , liu peiqi , ge zhijun , zhang haiyan director : zhou xiaowen producers : chen kumming and jimmy tan screenplay : lang yun cinematography : lu gengxin music : zhou xiaowen u . s . distributor : arrow releasing in chinese with subtitles in the course of cinematic history , there have been many great quests : searches for the holy grail , the ark of the covenant , the true nature of humankind , the essence of god , and , during this film from chinese director zhou xiaowen , a 29-inch television . on the road , the two become lovers , but theirs isn't exactly one of the great screen romances . the overall theme of ermo echoes a simple truism : it's often better wanting than having . afterwards , how much of that will be replaced by apathy ? zhou is certainly criticizing materialism here , but only in the larger context of examining how we define meaning in our lives . as was the case in qui ju , we are presented with a vivid contrast between rural and urban china . however , where zhang's film tended to meander , ermo stays focused , and the interaction between blindman and ermo presents a sexual element absent from the earlier movie . an expert at capturing subtle mannerisms , alia possesses the same kind of screen presence exhibited by gong li . although there's nothing wrong with her delivery of dialogue , the actress' facial expressions are her greatest asset . ermo is not an exceptionally well-written character , but alia does an excellent job of breathing life into her . ermo is certainly on less ambitious footing than the recent string of grand historical epics coming from china . in many ways , this is refreshing , as the simpler story gives the viewer a different view of chinese culture . and , although the message of ermo is presented seriously , zhou isn't above having a little fun , and his lighter touch is one of the most refreshing elements of this enjoyable little drama . 
the radiantly inviting my life so far by director hugh hudson ( chariots of fire ) is a good-spirited film about a family . but is it a family film ? not really . it doesn't quite fit the mold of what we've come to expect for something labeled a " family film , " not that it wouldn't be appropriate for kids at least 10 , the age of the story's protagonist . the story doesn't have much in the way of slapstick and the comedy is written with a sharp wit that never talks down to the audience . nicely framed with dramatic flourishes , the story is filled with touching humor that reminds us of our own childhood , especially when we first heard about sex . told without a single crude or vulgar moment , the sweet tale has a refreshing honesty and , most of all , an innocence that is light-years away from raunchy films like american pie . the intelligent script by simon donald is based on part of denis forman's autobiography . with the richness of one of the best masterpiece theater television series ( which is meant as a high compliment ) , the movie evokes a warmly nostalgic feeling for a time that few of us have ever experienced . as much a hobby as a business , the factory churns out moss products ranging from bandage substitutes to soap to cigars , not all of them successes . reasonably tolerant , edward only gets really worked up about the playing of jazz , which he loathes . both spouses start off as one-note characters , but slowly and subtly evolve into much richer and complex ones . mastrantonio , especially , gives a graceful performance that shows how much an actress can reveal about her character while keeping her emotions in check , as they would have been in that era . the talented supporting cast further enriches the production . the movie concerns the year that fraser was 10 . although many incidents occur , the most interesting of the lot surround the effect of fraser's reading habits . the genial comedy , which doesn't have or need much of a plot , finds a perfect little scene to wrap it up . when the ending credits start to roll , you feel thankful that the pettigrews have allowed you to spend time with them . the experience has felt more like a visit than a movie . my life so far runs just 1 : 33 . it is in scottish english which sometimes requires careful listening . the movie is rated pg-13 for sexual content , including some nude pictures . it would be fine for kids around 10 and up , but in order to appreciate the subject matter more , 12 and up would be better . my son jeffrey , age 10 , gave the movie * * and thought the story flipped around too much . john's twin steven , who gave the picture * * * 1/2 , really liked the story and thought it was funny . watching them , you could see that , like the 10-year-old in the picture , they sometimes felt uneasy about the ( non-explicit ) sexual content of the movie . 
director : robinson devor . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 90 minutes . pulp-noir is tough to pull off in this era of self-referential hipness . strangely enough , pulp-noir satire may be even tougher to pull off , since the entire genre itself fairly reeks of self-parody every time a hard-boiled guy , a hard-boiled situation and hard-boiled voice-over dialogue combine on screen . now take that pulp-noir satire and base it on a real pulp novel , and you've got the potential for a smug disaster . it _couldn't_ work . writer/director robinson devor had the recipe for yet another inert genre parody in his hands , but somehow he turned it into something so wonderfully warped it's almost impossible to resist . but he could be in for hard lessons about " the biz . " if the above summary sets you to puzzling over the film's title , fear not . in the 1950s and 1960s , willeford wrote within a genre where publishers couldn't care less what was inside the cover , so long as a broad in a tight sweater and a provocative title were on the cover . robinson devor uses willeford's own off-beat sensibility as a launching pad , then turns the woman chaser into such a twisted combination of subversion and homage that you can only ride along where it takes you . devor nails the genre atmosphere , helped greatly by kramer morgenthau's marvelous black-and-white a la kiss me deadly cinematography and warburton's note-perfect narration . parody only seems to work when it's inspired by genuine affection , and devor clearly loves film noir , mannered conventions and all . he also figures out that his story is a way to give a fresh twist to the trite independent film premise of making an independent film . from richard's intense pitch of his film's concept , to his unconventional methods of eliciting performances , to his obsession with the perfect edited length of his film , the woman chaser finds a kick for every predictable situation . taking the concept out of the present day film-making world gives it the perfect touch of the surreal , without even the faintest hint of the superior outsider attitude that too often hinders movies about making movies . there are ebbs in devor's pacing , and a narrative that doesn't always hang together except as a showcase for warburton's tremendously entertaining performance . yet even then there's entertainment value in virtually every aborted narrative thread . it's too easy to praise a film simply for being different , but the woman chaser is different in all the right ways . it's energetic and imaginative where other parodies are too often limp and witless . it skewers the ego of film-makers , but never loses its love for film-making . it even pokes fun at film noir without resorting to predictable gags . the woman chaser is a surprise in every positive sense of the word , because really , it shouldn't work . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : leslie bohem . director : rob cohen . running time : 115 minutes . it is one of the more trustworthy rules of popular culture that everything old must eventually become new again , and 1996 at the movies sure has looked a lot like the mid-70s . twister and independence day were less like contemporary action films than the were heirs to the disaster epics of twenty years ago , with plucky bands of one-dimensional characters trying to withstand barrages of special effects . with two volcano films and james cameron's titanic on the horizon , it is beginning to feel like irwin allen has taken over hollywood again , and that thought doesn't inspire much nostalgia . daylight is a poseidon adventure clone with a few effectively tense moments , but it is so plodding and mechanical that it is rarely entertaining . that leaves him in danger as well , though the greatest danger isn't entirely clear . daylight begins with a couple of red-herring criminal activities which end up causing the firestorm in the tunnel , but it is indicative of the shortcomings of the script that the bad guys then become cinders rather than sticking around to make any more sparks fly . there simply isn't enough to any of the characters to give the conflict energy ; everything we know about each of them comes from a series of postage-stamp sized establishing scenes , and that's not nearly enough . with the vague bureaucratic malevolence aboveground and the muted mutineering below ground as the only antagonism in most of daylight , the absence of a real villain becomes a distinct drawback , and results in a plot which grinds from impossible situation to yet-more-impossible situation . that is not to say that there is no drama in daylight , though little of it comes from the silly dialogue or thin characterizations . surprisingly , it also doesn't come from the special effects by industrial light and magic , which often have a strangely low-budget quality . repeatedly , characters are forced to decide who can be saved , or whether someone is worth saving , and director rob cohen ( dragonheart ) somehow makes those moments matter even though individual characters don't . that alone might be more than you would expect from a sylvester stallone action film , although sly himself merely seems to be going through the motions . screenwriter leslie bohem has handed him a character which even seems to be a barely re-worked version of his tragedy-scarred , redemption-hungry role in cliffhanger , and he wanders grimly through most of the film without showing us any hint of a personality . he also has to carry daylight on his broad shoulders , because this is one disaster film which doesn't blow its budget on putting an all-star cast in harm's way ; amy brenneman and viggo mortensen are no faye dunaway and fred astaire . however , daylight does try to follow up on one bit of disaster film trivia -- both the poseidon adventure and the towering inferno won best original song academy awards -- by serving up a sappy romantic ballad called " whenever there is love . " the female half of the duet ? donna summer . yes indeed , folks , it sure does feel like the mid-70s all over again . 
a big , loopy , overlong , dullish docudrama-style thriller , about the losing battle of the 'war on drugs . ' it is at times more preachy than dramatic , taking the point of view that something has to be done about the drug situation but not saying what , only that what's been tried has not worked and the youth of america are being unduly harmed by drugs . there's nothing new presented here : same old answers , same old film , but this one takes itself more serious because of the talented cast and the formulaic way this story was adapted from a simon moore work , which was scripted by stephen gaghan and directed with precision but in an uninspiring way by steven soderbergh . it first ran as a mini-series on british tv in 1989 , a medium it probably would be the most logical place to view this updated ambitious version . once all the stories are in place , the film shows how human frailty plays a part in the corruption of various individuals . manolo succumbs to being bribed by the drug lords as he is overwhelmed by the money he sees passing hands and does something he would never have done , if not tempted . the film wraps up neatly , tieing up all the tragic ongoing drug war stories . so he asks out loud , how can you wage a war against your own family ? the film soft pedals any advocacy for legalizing drugs and offers no hard-hitting critique of current policies , except to say it doesn't work . it seems to have safely placed itself in the middle of the argument , not taking sides ( a rather wishy-washy way to leave things ) . i don't know what could be said , other than this was a competently made film , the actors were forceful in their roles , with the plucky performance by the conflicted cop benicio del toro outshining the others , and for some comic relief , there was some amusing dialogue between cheadle and guzman . the film had a nice look to it , as cinematographer soderbergh aka peter andrews , has given the film a look of urgency , using a handheld camera , and working with different tinctures of desertlike yellow-orange shades and icy blue lighting to get a better view of his subjects and their hard-boiled tale . 
although their mindless banter is cute at first , listening to them becomes as tiresome as being stuck at a cocktail party between battling spouses . favreau , who wrote the bright script for swingers , writes and directs the surprisingly mediocre made . it's the type of film in which positive comments on its short running length will generate a good portion of the discussion afterwards . oh yes , and they are not supposed to talk to anyone . don't be surprised if you find yourself wishing that someone would jump out from a side street and plug one or both of them . one wishes that the actors would have fought more about the script before they started the filming , as both of their foulmouthed characters show potential . as people kept walking out of our screening , it was easier to sympathize with their plight than with the characters in the story . anything more is overkill . made runs 1 : 33 . it is rated r for pervasive language , some drug use and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . my son jeffrey , age 12 , gave the film * * . he thought that it was only " okay " and complained that it didn't have much of plot . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
the two of them , who evidence no chemistry on the screen , go through the motions , but not the emotions , of an affair . they are careful to tell each other " i love you , " but they never convince each other , much less the audience . isabelle huppert creates her rich businesswoman character as a complete enigma . vincent martinez's acting isn't much better . he plays an uncaring rogue , who isn't interesting enough to detest . since the only reason she pays him to live with her is for the sex , you'd think the sex would be erotic and exciting , but it is incredibly bland . the script by jacques fieschi , based on a novel by yukio mishima , has exactly one " surprise , " but it is so obviously telegraphed that it is an insult to the viewers' intelligence . don't be surprised if your audience yells out at the screen . after the setup , the movie quickly gets as stale as a week-old croissant . " no man will ever give you what you want , " quentin complains to dominique . since she reveals so little about herself , quentin is probably right . spending the entire movie staring off into space , she certainly doesn't give the audience what it wants with her cold and aloof performance . the film is in french with english subtitles . it is rated r for sex , nudity , profanity and dope smoking and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
it's hard piloting a large spacecraft through a space station if the only practice you've ever had is with cardboard models on a television series . needless to say , our reluctant heroes have no idea , well no real idea , what to do . in dean parisot's side-splittingly funny galaxy quest , this delicious concept is milked for every joke possible . setting a perfect comedic tone , the movie is a delightful and imaginative parody of star trek , right down to their hokey conventions with adoring fans , dressed in full and authentic series regalia . the campy movie never veers into slapstick , and the ensemble cast plays every scene with complete seriousness and believability . given the volume and the frequency of the laughter that the film produces , it could be thought of as the pg comedic equivalent of there's something about mary . galaxy quest makes silly ideas so likeably funny that you can't control your laughter , even if you try . never surrender ! " nesmit is an extroverted , egocentric actor who plays the convention crowds like he's a rock star . needless to say , demarco has never been pleased with her highly limited role . every science fiction show needs lots of expendable crew members . with voices rather like porpoises and gestures that blend many animal behaviors , the thermians produce instant mirth whenever they are on the set . they've even reconstructed the protector , right down to gadgets that they have no idea how to work but are sure the real crew will . the film's purposely ridiculous monsters range from innocent-looking alien babies with sharp teeth to lumbering rock monsters to a grotesquely rotund pig , all done with spoofing , not frightening , in mind . with a constant look of " oh my god , i can't believe i'm doing this , " the actors try their best to fake it . although most of them convincingly do and say the right things , fleegman doesn't have the same ad-libbing skills as the others . for all of those scriptwriters who don't think through the logic of their stories , the movie shows what can happen . " whoever wrote this episode should die ! " only flagging briefly when it tries momentarily to get serious , the parody is likely to appeal as well to 10-year-olds as to senior citizens . there's even a " gilligan's island " joke . yes , the thermians think it's a documentary , and they feel quite sorry for those poor people stuck on that island . it is rated pg for silly monsters and a little mild profanity . the film would be fine for all ages , but the monsters may briefly frighten some impressionable young kids . my son jeffrey , age 10 , gave the film * * * * . he laughed loudly and often . words i heard afterwards from them included : imaginative , exciting , hilarious , great plot , best movie in a long time , etc . the kids were blown away by the movie . 
british humor is often at its peak when it mixes droll wit with monty pythonesque weirdness . this certainly isn't the perfect fare for mainstream america , but for those who enjoy a touch of the bizarre with their laughter , leon the pig farmer makes an excellent one-hundred minute diversion . leon the pig farmer is a singularly entertaining motion picture . its co-directors , gary sinyor and vadim jean , have done an excellent job pacing the film ( until the very end , when everything sputters to an abrupt halt ) . the types of humor are spread around evenly , avoiding long periods of stagnation between the funny parts . there are moments guaranteed to bring on bursts of uncontrolled laughter , but more often , leon causes its audience to smile and chuckle--the product of recognizing the clever wit of a situation . there's a substantial dash of the unusual in leon's humor--the sort of material that brings to mind monty python or black adder . the unexpected is often the greatest asset of such comedy--and it's present in abundance . how many times do strangers approach someone to give advice on intimate matters ? as enjoyable as all this zaniness is , there's a none-to-subtle message to go along with it about being true to oneself . the directors don't have an axe to grind , but they offer this for those who want some substance amidst the silliness . the cast contains a number of well-respected british actors , including brian glover and janet suzman . known primarily for dramatic roles , these two give wonderful comic turns , proving that leslie nielsen isn't the only one who can put a staid reputation to good use . maryam d'abo is marvellous as the manic madeleine , and hers is easily the standout performance . mark frankel , who plays leon , sometimes overacts his role ( especially when he's around pigs ) , but he's generally solid and has a good knack for comedy . his performance keeps the film moving , and his chemistry with his two leading ladies ( d'abo and bellman ) is effective . it's easy to see why leon has been such a hit on the film festival circuit over the past year . it's a thoroughly charming movie in the same vein as another little-known british comedy , getting it right ( which is available on video ) . i hadn't initially planned to see this movie ( believe it or not ) , but the positive advance word piqued my curiosity . this is one unexpected trip to the theater that i haven't regretted . 
[note that the follow-up is set to rec . arts . sf . written rather than rec . art . sf . movies . this was done on purpose . the whole wide world a film review by steve rhodes copyright 1997 steve rhodes your eyes may be playing tricks on you . the title of this movie is the whole wide world and not the world wide web . many computer types will probably have to parse the name several times to get it right . this is a film not about the net , but about someone known as " the greatest pulp fiction writer in the whole wide world . " the only real reason to see the film is to catch more of that new star from jerry maguire , renee zellweger , in one of the movie's two leading roles . although it has a classic three tissue ending , the rest of the picture is a remarkably unmoving portrayal of two characters full of potential . as flat as the texas prairie , the movie saves all of its emotional impact until the end . the cinematography by claudio rocha is gorgeous . you may remember his stunning work in picture bride . here he shows texas as its best -- full of reddish golden colors . the prettiest images are the sunsets , but the forest canopy is warm and inviting as well . the best sequence has the camera pan down slowly from the highest branches to the seemingly insignificant people under them . making a living producing pulp fiction isn't easy . he reveals that his solution is , " i stretch it out ; i'm verbose . " bob is not prime date material . his idea of a good time is " drivin' and blabbin' , " which he does frequently in the movie . herein lies the major problem with the film . screenwriter michael scott myers rarely gives him anything to say worth hearing . even if this stems from deficiencies in the book , myers should have been able to fix it . this is compounded by dan ireland's meandering direction and luis colina's loose editing . there are the ingredients for a good movie here , but the mixture we are given does not gel . the two leads give good performances , but the rest of the cast , especially all of novalyne's women friends , are weak . i found the " texan spoken here " sign at the soda fountain quite ironic since few of the characters even attempt an accent . those that do come up with a weak , vaguely southern accent . in a small texas town before the advent of television , you can be sure that all the accents would have been so thick you could have cut them with a knife . this is not even close . no matter how hard zellweger and d'onofrio try , the movie never made me care about their characters . zellweger's part was made more earnest than touching by the script , and d'onofrio's was reduced to quirkiness . in the finale , when it came time to break out the kleenex , my eyes stayed dry . some of people in the audience whimpered , but i was never more than intrigued by the film . a promising story , but a disappointing delivery . the whole wide world runs 1 : 45 . it is rated pg . there are a couple of mild cuss words , but no sex , nudity or violence . given the mature themes , kids would probably have to be nine or ten to be interested in the show . although the film has its moments , it is not compelling cinema . i give it a mild thumbs down and * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
there's nothing particularly deep or challenging about this movie . the title , fled , says it all . for most of its one-hundred minute running length , this is one chase after another . when the film keeps moving , and doesn't dwell on things like character development or plot plausibility , it offers a certain minimum entertainment value . unfortunately , there are lulls when attempts are made at exposition , and , during those periods , fled becomes unbearably dull , not to mention incredibly stupid . actually , kevin hooks' energetic direction , coupled with laurence fishburne's commanding presence , makes this picture more watchable than it has a right to be . aside from occasional , clever quips ( such as tongue-in-cheek references to the fugitive and fishburne's oscar- nominated performance in what's love got to do with it ) , there's nothing remarkable about the creaky script , which does everything it possibly can to keep the two leads on the run from good guys , bad guys , and everyone in between . logic and intelligence have little part in these proceedings . the defiant ones was a multi-layered film ; fled is pure escapism with nothing under the surface . it's stock bits of lethal weapon , the fugitive , and 48 hours rolled into one . ( bad feds again -- haven't these guys been the villains in every other movie this summer ? ) stephen baldwin , one of the interchangeable acting baldwin brothers , is adequate , and salma hayek ( desperado ) is attractive , but fled's attention magnet is fishburne . he's a good friend of hooks' , which explains his presence here , but those who sit through this movie won't care why he appears -- they'll just be glad he does . otherwise , enduring the film would be far more difficult . there's not much else to be said about fled . it's not a complete entertainment wasteland , but this is definitely not the time of year to distribute such a routine , unspectacular action feature . it probably would have played better against less imposing competition . so , although fled hints at the promise of its director , who previously made passenger 57 , it's not the kind of picture that will get people racing to theaters . when the movie's over , you're likely to be left feeling that , despite all the running around , you really haven't gotten anywhere . 
date released : 10/29/93 ( general ) running length : 2 : 04 rated : r ( mature themes , language , charred bodies ) while standing on a station platform waiting for an oncoming train , have you ever wondered what would happen if you threw yourself on the tracks ? or , while atop a high building , have you ever been teased by an impulse - regardless of how brief and irrational - to throw yourself off the edge ? fearless is much like a masterful , but incomplete , painting . at the center of the canvas , where the primary focus lies , the colors are brilliant and the image fully-realized . but moving towards the edges , the grays begin to dominate and the coherence of the picture fragments . this movie knows and develops its main theme with undeniable accuracy and power , but many of the subplots and lesser ideas are left untold or vaguely fleshed out . this is one of those rare films that gets the audience to think while still telling a gripping story . the issues it presents are not easy to grapple with , nor are there pat solutions held ready for mass consumption . as max puts it , " people don't so much believe in god as they choose not to believe in nothing . " that one line says as much about his character as it does the intentions of this motion picture . max isn't particularly likable , but we feel for him nonetheless . he gives us a max that we aren't likely to identify with , but who doesn't promote audience apathy , either . isabella rossellini is not as effective as laura - she doesn't always have the best grip on her character - but her part doesn't demand the same level of intensity . for the most part , perez's acting is understated , which makes sudden bursts of emotion all the more forceful . not only in hulce totally unconvincing , but this particular element of the story is pointless and distracting . john turturro doesn't fare much better . i never accepted him as a therapist , and his presence adds little to fearless . the theatrical trailers for this movie would lead you to believe that it's an uplifting experience . nothing could be further from the truth . while there are a few moments of emotional exultation , most of the movie explores darker elements of human nature . the score , by maurice jarre , is suitably eerie at all the right times . there is no grand fanfare or devastating crescendo during the crash sequences . instead , we get an unearthly , almost-silent theme that seems to slow down the action , lending added impact to the tragedy . great care is taken to show the hero worship exhibited by the boy who followed max out of the plane , but beyond the setup , little is done . there is so much untapped potential here that it seems a crime for director peter weir to give it such cursory treatment . fearless is an impressive film even considering the untapped potential . the interactions of the three main characters are potent without being shocking or sensationalistic ( especially those between max and carla ) , and the import of the questions raised isn't diminished because of the lack of firm answers . the final scene is a fitting , if highly-symbolic , conclusion to all that goes before it , and should provide fodder for post-movie conversations and/or reflections . fearless is not a film that you walk away from and immediately forget . 
starring : robert armstrong , bruce cabot , fay wray directors : merian c . cooper and ernest b . schoedsack producers : merian c . cooper and ernest b . state-of-the-art visual effects , an entertaining story , and a touching ending combined to bequeath upon this film the coveted label of a " classic . " it its era - and , indeed , for decades after - no monster movie approached the lofty perch of this one . many rip-offs , one remake , and a film called jurassic park have come and gone . while the original king kong still sits upon the throne of our memories , the said reality is that advances in technology and acting have outdated the movie . it deserves credit for what it once was , but the time of its greatness is past . though it is perhaps in our nature to embrace this film because of what it represents , and because of its role in motion picture history , those who deny king kong's flaws deny reality . the plot is reasonably straightforward - not a bad thing for a monster movie . the story stands up pretty well today . in fact , with the exception of a few " modernizing " changes , the basic frame was left intact for the 1976 dino delaurentiis remake . character development , on the other hand , is nonexistent . strange as it might sound , kong is the most thoroughly explored personality in the film . driscoll and ann are types ( the dashing hero and the damsel in distress ) , and denham isn't given much more depth ( the ruthless movie maker who's actually not such a bad guy ) . the acting is part of the problem . what was acceptable in 1933 is inadequate when compared to even the mediocre performances of today . it's next-to-impossible to accept any of the three lead actors as anything other than people reciting lines . and as for the actual words they were expected to say . . . how's this for dialogue : " some big , hard- boiled egg gets a look at a pretty face and bang ! there's very little about king kong that the word " corny " doesn't describe . the special effects , which once were so impressive , now pale in comparison to what has been accomplished in jurassic park . on a technical level , it's possible to appreciate the miniatures work in king kong , but they aren't nearly as awe-inspiring as they were before ilm let the genie out of the bottle . sometimes , it's not always the best thing to re-watch an older , well-beloved movie . rarely does the real thing equal the images preserved and enhanced in our memories . despite its various deficiencies and antiquated style , i still retain a fondness for king kong . my overall opinion of this film , however , has been formed more by childhood impressions than those garnered through any later , critical viewing . ultimately , the mystique of king kong lies not so much in what it offers today , but what it has contributed during the course of the last six decades . 
screenplay : chuck pfarrer and jonathan lemkin . director : antony hoffman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes , brief nudity , profanity ) running time : 106 minutes . some genre films tease you with the prospect that they can be something more substantial before degenerating into stupidity and cliche . red planet at least does viewers the courtesy of not wasting their time with such futile hopes . and that scientist burchenal ( tom sizemore ) , he sure has an ego , which undoubtedly will create some sort of character tension down the road . dim-wittedness in hollywood action films is only to be expected at this point in cinema history . vaguely pretentious dim-wittedness is pretty inexcusable . you see , earth has become nearly uninhabitable due to environmental degradation , and our only hope of survival is creating a survivable atmosphere elsewhere , but something has gone screwy because oxygen readings have suddenly dropped . at certain points in red planet , you can't help but wonder why anyone wasted time on a back story at all . though the very survival of the human race is theoretically at stake , the film seems interested in that point only to the extent that it can be included in press notes , in absurd declarations like , " it's a smart movie that posits the question , what if man fails to do the things necessary to live on earth ? " in fact , red planet resolutely refuses to deal with anything beyond the basic goals of its characters to find a way back to earth . what exactly was the reason that no one could detect any oxygen , when it turns out there's a whole lot of it around ? and why flirt with the notion that there's some intelligence bent on thwarting the terraforming effort , only to make the real villain of the piece the crew's resident malfunctioning evil robot ? silly questions , of course , since red planet is kind enough to alert you so quickly to its minimalist intentions . the characters spout dialogue that alternates between inane exposition and pointless self-characterization . " we're sexually attracted to one another , so i hope neither one of us dies , " say bowman and gallagher , though not in so many words . " i sure wish it didn't take 40 minutes for you to answer , " says bowman after sending a radio message to earth , actually in so many words , just to let us know the writers knew at least one science fact . it's a wonderful irony in red planet that it places so much weight on the fate of these six characters , only to make them utterly weightless as actual characters . at odd intervals , something happens to slap the film out of its oxygen-deprived stupor . most of them involve moss , whose strong presence occasionally tricks you into thinking the film is better than it is . one involves a great shot of the mars lander taking a tumble for which it certainly wasn't designed . and , sadly , many others involve the pleasure of watching one or another of the annoying characters meet an untimely demise . as directed by rookie feature director antony hoffman , this is a lame special effects-driven action film that can't even be bothered to provide a handful of visceral thrills . lacking big-time action excitement , competent story-telling or any desire to prevent you from walking out scratching deep trenches into your head , red planet is simply a planet-sized waste of time . but at least it only wastes a few minutes of your time before making that obvious . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
like the even better movie das boot , which i thought was fascinating , stalingrad is a chillingly effective picture . stalingrad by director joseph vilsmaier is an effective anti-war film that has more in common with all quiet on the western front than with any other film . the film is so anti-war , that you leave the theater wanting to find a newspaper , pick the first war you read about , and leave to go protest against it . very effective . gore , mein gott , does this show have gore . given what they were depicting , i do not think the violence is gratuitous , but you may want to bring one of those airline barf bags with you to the show . you will see lots of limbs blow away with bloody cartilage dangling in the wind . in one scene we see a war time amputation with a less than sharp knife . blood flows everywhere . there is no glorification of war in this movie whatsoever . there is a long sequence about some of them trying to go awol that is reminiscent of catch 22 . the show is genuine in its emotions . an old timer consoles him by telling him , don't worry , i've done it myself . the cinematography ( rolf greim , klaus moderegger , and peter von haller ) deserves lots of awards . although the film is realistic , the music ( norbert juergen schneider ) is overdone and would fit better in one of those pseudo-epic films . the costumes ( ute hofinger ) and the sets ( jindrich goetz and wolfgang hundhammer ) effectively illustrate the horror of that time and are excellent . like das boot , the small items add realism . the movie depicts all germans above the level of captain to be sadists . stalingrad runs 2 : 12 , but the effective editing by hannes nikel makes the time go by fast . it is in german with easy to read english subtitles . this gut wrenching film is unrated , and knowing the mpaa they would probably give it an r . personally , i think it is definitely nc-17 . it would probably be okay for mature teenagers over 16 . i recommend this show to you , but i think it sad to say that probably few people will ever see it . the theme of this movie cries out to be seen . finally , i award the film * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
thus far , most of the movies to transport audiences to the reagan era have been characterized by nostalgia , generation x angst , or sophomoric humor . there's also a social message here about how many of the shallow life-views adopted during the period continue to plague our culture today . while disco music has gone and returned , many of the ideals that were around at the time of its demise have persisted ever since . the last days of disco is very different from any of the other late-'70s/early-'80s movies . sure , there's the requisite disco soundtrack loaded with tunes from sister sledge , donna summer , and others , and there are plenty of scenes featuring oddly-attired young people dancing under the flashing light of a strobe , but this film is packed with stillman characters , and , more importantly , stillman dialogue . only a handful of working film makers are capable of presenting the english language with the artistry and rhythm employed here ( tarantino and mamet come to mind ) , and the director's approach makes apparently-banal conversations come alive . there's not as much dialogue in the last days of disco as there is in either of stillman's previous features , metropolitan and barcelona , but what there is , is done in his inimitable style . for example , there are discourses about whether yuppies really exist , why vds aren't all bad , how virginity is defined , and whether it's a good idea to follow shakespeare's maxim , " to thine own self be true . " plus , there's a hilarious deconstruction of disney's lady and the tramp , where one character claims the movie's function is to " program women to adore jerks . " there are various romantic pairings , few of which amount to anything . in fact , with the exception of alice , who has principles and ambition , no one in this film is especially likable or intelligent . this is obviously intentional , since it allows stillman to make a cynical , satirical point about what's wrong with society , and how certain problems have their roots in the disco culture . the movie's only obvious misstep is a subplot that involves money-laundering and seems designed to impel the narrative forward toward a resolution it might not otherwise achieve . with a perfect american accent and a demeanor that recalls parker posey , beckinsale fashions her character as the picture of the shallow , vain party girl . by forging an emotional connection with the audience ; sevigny becomes our way into the story . there are also welcome cameos from several cast members of metropolitan and barcelona . stillman may have a message to present , but he does it without preaching , and in such a way that the audience has a lot of fun along the way . there's nothing inherently brilliant about the movie or its theme , but the combination of sharply-realized dialogue and infectiously energetic dance sequences keeps the last days of disco from losing steam . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
cast : jerzy stuhr , malgorzata zabkowska , ewa pokas , stefan czyzewski , jerzy nowak , krzysztof zanussi director : krzysztof kieslowski producer : wielislawa piotrowska screenplay : krzysztof kieslowski and jerzy stuhr cinematography : jacek petrycki music : krzysztof knittel u . s . distributor : new yorker films in polish with subtitles call camera buff a case of art imitating life . although director krzysztof kieslowski admitted that this film doesn't tell his own story ( " i made films because that was my profession , and i was too lazy or too stupid or both to change . . . " ) , it will undoubtedly strike a responsive chord with many amateur and professional film makers . yet , while the movie is about the love of a craft , this isn't a nostalgia-drenched account of that appreciation . kieslowski developed camera buff's deceptively complex script so that it addressed weightier themes : obsession , censorship , and the battle between artistic integrity and personal sacrifice . fans of kieslowski's later style ( which began to emerge in no end ) may find camera buff's light , occasionally playful tone disconcerting . although the film deals with serious themes , kieslowski never allows the proceedings to grow maudlin or overly-introspective . the script is peppered with serio-comic incidents that leaven what could have been a staid , sober story . nevertheless , the manner in which the plot unfolds and the interconnected issues are confronted announces camera buff as a picture of considerable substance . but , from the moment he looks through the lens , filip is hooked . [shooting films means] more than a home and family . " why does he make films ? and do they mean anything if they are reduced to propaganda pieces instead of genuine depictions of the world as he sees it ? this all sounds rather grim , but , perhaps surprisingly , camera buff may be the funniest of kieslowski's features ( although both decalogue 10 and white have their moments ) . none of the humor is excessive or intrusive , but there are moments of the absurd that maintain a relaxed tone , and filip's enthusiasm is infectious . kieslowski isn't attempting to bludgeon us with preachy morality lessons ; his intent is to explore certain issues in an entertaining manner . and , while camera buff lacks some of the artistry evident in the director's later projects , it's worth seeing not only as an example of kieslowski's early work , but as an important film in its own right . 
if the score of immortal beloved is remarkable , that of the madness of king george is no less so . with the clear strains of handel's " water music " and " zadok the priest " in the background , the madness of king george ascends to a level that it might never have attained using a modern composer . the musical selections ( made by george fenton ) are so perfectly and expertly interwoven into the film that one might easily assume the score had been specifically written for nicholas hytner's production . the doctors--mostly a bunch of jumped-up quacks--do nothing for him . the madness of king george is much more than a simple study of one man's descent into insanity . with a style that's more tongue-in-cheek than melodramatic , the film is always witty and occasionally satirical . medical historians are generally agreed that the cause of george's madness was something called porphyria , an acute , intermittent , hereditary disease that is physical ( rather than mental ) in nature . the king's symptoms , including blue urine and gastric crises , match those of porphyria , although some have postulated that there may have been a secondary affliction , such as manic-depression , involved . whatever the case , as this film illustrates , it's clear that there were times when george was unfit to rule . another constantly takes the king's pulse . a third advocates examining the royal chamberpots--the stool being " more eloquent than the pulse . " only dr . willis , with his hypnotic gaze , gives the impression of competence . without exception , the acting is top-notch . the four principles--hawthorne , mirren , holm , and everett--do fine jobs . hawthorne's performance is especially noteworthy , allowing us to understand , and occasionally even sympathize , with a decidedly arrogant and dislikable personality . despite allusions to king lear , this movie's strength is in its story breadth , not its depth . a lot happens here , but few of the themes take root beyond their surface meaning . adapted from the play the madness of george iii , the film trims copious portions of dialogue , leaving behind a tightly-paced picture that has the feel of something created for the screen rather than for the stage . certain subplots are watered down or eliminated , but what survives is more than enough to keep king george a source of solid entertainment . 
screenplay : paul attanasio . director : robert redford . there is a certain irony to the involvement of robert redford in the making of quiz show . much like quiz show's anti-hero charles van doren , redford became a star based on nothing so much as his golden boy good looks and charm . there is perhaps even more irony in the selling of quiz show as a story about a loss of american innocence , since it may be the ultimate debunking of the myth of the eisenhower-era american dream . brilliantly written and directed , it is a tale of how television sold us what we wanted to believe about our country , and a frighteningly contemporary examination of the cult of image . quiz show opens with a visually arresting sequence which perfectly establishes the foundation for redford and screenwriter paul attanasio . it's all about the dream , a dream of equal opportunity that doesn't exist on the quiz show's carefully controlled , demographically attractive selection of champions . morrow's is just one of a half-dozen performances in quiz show which will draw academy award consideration . veteran actor paul scofield is dynamic as mark van doren , whose mere commanding presence does as much to explain the younger van doren's motivations as fiennes' performance ; their scenes together are spectacular . david paymer is also noteworthy as the slick and savvy enright . for my money , however , the true star of quiz show is paul attanasio , whose screenplay is certainly the finest of the year . every characterization is full and rounded ; every scene is a perfect development of theme . the dialogue is filled with crisp , subtle and quotable lines . in one perfect moment , charles van doren's indignant insistence to enright that " i am a professor at columbia , " is followed by a studio gopher who announces , " the professor's needed in makeup . " quiz show is yet another example of what is possible when a script is this good , the direction is perfectly complementary , and the acting is first-rate . the film to beat as 1994's best picture has arrived . 
while it's true that making good romantic comedies is still something of an art , producing average films of the genre has become a science . take a little chemistry , a portion of physics , some basic biology , and mix them together according to a well-understood formula , and you have a result guaranteed to give audiences everywhere that mushy , feel-good sensation they crave . while you were sleeping , a movie likely to appeal to the sleepless in seattle crowd , is a perfect example of this unoriginal-but-enjoyable type of film making . the story opens with a voiceover as the camera gives us the sights of modern-day chicago . while you were sleeping is a pleasant movie that looks like it was originally designed for a christmas release . considering 1994's pathetic holiday fare ( mixed nuts , trapped in paradise ) , it would have been welcome . nevertheless , no love story is confined by a time of year , and this one works nearly as well in april as in december . the story has a little more depth than the usual romantic drivel . just no one to laugh with . " the relationship is warm but not especially passionate . there certainly aren't any sparks , and physical contact is limited to a kiss under the mistletoe . in some ways , this restrained view of love and sex is a throwback to hollywood's early era . sandra bullock ( speed ) is an amazingly engaging performer . though not the best actress of her generation , she has a winning smile and a variety of noteworthy expressions . she's perhaps at her best looking bewildered , and this movie gives her plenty of opportunities to do that . the supporting cast is okay , although everyone appears a little too cheerful for a family whose son is in a coma . while you were sleeping has its share of nice moments , none of which are especially memorable . the plot runs out of steam just past the one-hour mark and the charade , although necessary to the story , goes on for too long . the ending is , of course , the requisite happy one , but it seems a little anticlimactic . and we definitely don't need bullock's narration to supply us with the meaning of the title . all-in-all , while you were sleeping delivers what it advertises : no surprises , but a load of warm feelings . 
i have good news for you . you -- yes , you ! -- could be a filmmaker and have your name in lights . no , you don't have to go to film school . you don't have to think of a story . and you don't even have to film your movie ; you already have the ingredients on the shelves in your den -- those homemade videotapes . no , not those sharp looking new ones made with your fancy new camcorder . those old , grainy , shaky ones , in which your subjects ramble quasi-unintelligibly . your masterpiece can even win the " dogme 95 " seal of approval , which says that your film was made without use of artificial lights , sounds , props , etc . there is probably a story buried there somewhere , but it takes the press notes to decipher it , not that you'd care . the film is the first american movie made according to the dogme 95 precepts . sandwiched between long cinematic wastelands are periodic incidents designed to disgust us . ( the colors in the film are so far off that one can never be sure what the actual color was . ) in the story's pi ? ce de r ? sistance , a performer comes to entertain some kids . in another episode , an armless card player jokes about not having a card up his sleeve . " i don't really like it . it's too artsy-fartsy . " the father then goes on to describe part of a " real movie " -- a dirty harry movie . the father's mere description of a scene from that movie was better than the entire julien donkey-boy , a movie so edgy that you'd like to push it off the edge of a cliff . it is rated r for language , some sexuality and disturbing images . it would be acceptable for teenagers , who would likely be just as bored as the adults . 
shawn , john ratzenberger , jim varney , annie potts , and others director : john lasseter producers : ralph guggenheim and bonnie arnold screenplay : joss whedon , andrew stanton , joel cohen , and alec sokolow music : randy newman u . s . distributor : walt disney pictures toy story , disney's first feature-length foray into computer animation , postulates that they do it all by themselves . any who doubt this should take a look a t toy story . you'll never again feel quite the same way about mr . pota to head , monkeys in a barrel , or slinkies . of course , the visual aspect is the centerpiece of toy story . t he computer-generated effects are a marvel . rich in unexpected detail ( the grain of a wood floor , fingerprints and chipped paint on a door , reflections in polished surfaces , and so on ) , this colorful and brilliantly-rendered aspect of the film would alone be worth the price of admission . it's something of a bonus that the characters , dialogue , and story provide entertainment value of their own . toy story is a buddy movie/adventure tale with an understated lesson about the value of friendship . while the screenplay isn't a marvel of originality , it is capable of holding the attention--light , undemanding fun that n ever gets too immature or syrupy . there's also quite a bit of intelligent wit that will go above the heads of younger viewers--that stuff's for mom and dad . but that's a typical convention of animation . how does toy story compare to disney's more conventional animated features ? they're really very different types of productions . this film is less artistic and more technologically impressive . despite a few randy newman songs , it's not really a musical . of course , the target audience is the same , and everything from disney embraces " family values " , but it's difficult--and unfair--to make an effective contrast of the two film making styles . the one big negative about toy story involves disney's overcommercialization . it won't be long before the movie is drowned in hype . so , from the perspective of pure entertainment , it's a good idea to see toy story before the deluge of promotions becomes so excessive that it turns off every adult . frankly , the movie deserves a less ignominious fate than the marketing overkill which will surely overcome it . 
a real-life chilling tale of matricide is put forth in a complex build-up of an obsessive and passionate relationship between two very imaginative adolescent girls , set in christchurch , new zealand , between 1953 and 1954 . the 33-year-old director , new zealander peter jackson ( braindead/dead alive ) , previously known for making gore films , has come up with a stunning melodramatic story , spoiled only by the director's excessive camera shots of the girls' fantasy world , which was more arty than enlightening . pauline is shy but bright , heavy-set and plain looking , from a working-class and uneducated family , with a scarred leg from a few operations due to weak bone structure ; while , juliet is pretty and slender , worldly , aggressively sure of herself , from an upper-class , well-educated family , but is suffering from tuberculosis . by tossing fantasy and reality together in such a haphazard manner , it creates a world of disturbing visions , one in which the film holds the viewer's interest throughout . it feels like we can't quite grasp what is on the girls' minds , even if we are privileged to hear pauline's troubling voiceover , explaining her diary notations , even if we are caught by the exilaratingly romantic moods of the girls and their imaginative games they play . the acting by winslet and lynskey is superb . the film is also visually stunning , but the moral of the story is never made clear and there is bit too much pretentious fantasy art thrown into the script . 
the film's poetic title can be explained as follows : that the sun always sets instead of rises during the day of an execution . they are more interested to see how the chair works than in anything else . the jury didn't believe the 'ghost story' he told . but 46 says he can't be fooled , he would know his gestures anywhere . the story was well told , but the acting left a lot to be desired . and all that religious stuff thrown in , about how god listens to you , was strictly cornball . but as far as b-films go , this one is above average . 
in this movie adaptation , however , the shadow knows nothing , because the movie , from start to finish , is just an exercise in style . now don't get me wrong , this is great style . think of the feel of batman but without quite such depressing sets . think of batman , but with better special effects . okay , you have now successfully formed an image of the shadow in your mind . all this having been said , none of it matters . the director russell mulcahy uses the plot in the movie only to display and enhance the mood and the style of picture . all over the big apple , down buildings and between buildings , the shadow has strung these pneumatic tubes which no one ever seems to notice . although the technical ideas above were quite innovative , the script by david koepp wasn't . he should have worried some about character development and not gotten so carried away with the gadgets . the lighting , especially the lights and the shadows ( what else ) , are terrific . the cinematography ( stephen h . burum ) is dark like batman , but here it is made to be more serious than depressing . the shadow gets a correct pg-13 rating and runs too long at 1 : 50 . unless you are really into style and art decoration , i can not recommend this show . no one acts in it . the actors and actresses are all props merely to promote the mood . for the style i give it * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
screenplay : kevin meyer and keith samples . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 95 minutes . a plot synopsis for a smile like yours reads like the most generic of bittersweet romantic comedies . sounds quite a bit like she's having a baby , doesn't it ? only it's more like she's _not_ having a baby , because a smile like yours is a bittersweet romantic comedy about infertility . that's right , all the wacky hijinks of masturbating into a cup ! all the side-splitting humor of spending an hour in stirrups ! i can understand the temptation to search for humor in a subject as frustrating , embarrassing and occasionally guilt-inducing as fertility problems . perhaps either writer/director keith samples or his co-writer kevin meyer had some personal experience in this area , and felt the need to share their quest for a smile amidst the tears . and it might have worked if they had bothered to include a single honest moment in a smile like yours . there is no attempt to understand how danny and jennifer really feel about their dilemma , no sense of any genuine pain . samples and meyer have merely grafted a few scenes at a fertility clinic onto a fluffy and absurdly predictable relationship comedy , forcing you to wonder why it couldn't just as easily have been about a couple struggling with financial problems , or an irritating relative , or the heartbreak of psoriasis . it's actually fairly impressive how generic and predictable a smile like yours turns out to be . the casting certainly doesn't help matters , offering the mundanely attractive kinnear and holly as our protagonists without once stepping inside their heads ( we never learn why jennifer is so underhanded about trying to get pregnant , considering danny seems perfectly comfortable with the idea ) . even the supporting cast -- jay thomas as the acerbic guy pal , joan cusack as the daffy gal pal -- appears to have been generated by a computer program . the film is so ennervated for so long that a late cameo by shirley maclaine provides virtually the entire energy quotient in three minutes of screen time . for an hour and a half a smile like yours trudges in the most obvious directions , reaching a grating climax in a scene where several agonizing seconds pass between the moment we _know_ jennifer is going to call danny's hotel room and find another woman there , and the moment the phone actually rings . infertility may be a delicate issue , but it's hardly sacrosanct . a competent film-making team might have made either an exaggerated black comedy or a more sensitive comedy-drama about the issue . it deserves much better than to become an afterthought in a story which has nothing creative or insightful to offer on any subject . you know you're in trouble when the biggest laugh in a film comes during a scene when a character is watching a rerun of " i love lucy " . . . and the laugh is actually _at_ the rerun of " i love lucy . " lucy is still funnier -- and more inventive -- after 40 years than a smile like yours is after 40 minutes . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
opera , basketball and prejudice : an unlikely combination for any film , especially for one set in small town america towards the end of world war i . rich cowan's the basket is a simple and poetic film whose magic comes from many sources , particularly two beautifully understated performances by peter coyote and karen allen . the director makes the bold assumption that the audience has both intelligence and patience . in a film filled with messages -- " to defend a mighty wall , each one must fight for something small , " the opera says -- most are delivered with quiet delicacy , leaving the viewers to ascertain the fullness of their meanings and their portent for the story at hand . " i thought the war for us had finally ended , but it hadn't , " helmut explains in voice-over . with a bostonian accent as thick as helmut's german one , mr . conlon sticks out like a peach basket nailed up to a wall . things having not advanced much , that's exactly how the teacher introduces the game to his pupils , who had barely heard of the sport . this creates a buzz of excitement in the village because he dribbles out the story like episodes of a soap opera . " or any place for that matter . " filmed frequently with the warm glow of the setting sun , the rolling pastures of washington state look invitingly bucolic . this little filmed area of the united states clearly deserves to have more movies set there . although the journey is the reward in this movie , its big game ending manages more surprises than you'd ever expect , one being the half-time refreshments of the other team : beer and big cigars . even the game's slower pacing , which matches that of the movie , possesses an undeniable charm . a heartfelt motion picture , the basket is a delightful film worth savoring for those willing to take the time to enjoy its methodical rhythms . it's a film that gives family entertainment a good name and one that will have you still enjoying it in your memory after you leave the theater . it is rated pg for some mild violence and brief language and would be fine for all ages . 
france/guinea , 1994 running length : 1 : 28 mpaa classification : no mpaa /96 , 5/12/96 cast : baba camara , madou camara , kouda camara , moussa keita , koumba doumbouya , yaya traore director : laurent chevalier producer : beatrice korc screenplay : laurent chevalier , freely adapted from the novel by laye camara cinematography : amar arhab music : momo wandel soumah in french and malinke with subtitles film maker laurent chevalier has chosen a unique , perhaps unprecedented , manner of adapting laye camara's 1953 autobiography , l'enfant noir . actually , there are arguments why this film might have been better- suited to the documentary format ( indeed , the voiceover and camera style are like those of a documentary ) . the narrative is stark and simple , with little or no dramatic content . character development is minimal . chevalier is more interested in presenting themes and ideas about change across africa , culture shock , and the maturation of a boy in a changing world . because of the weak dramatic structure , however , most of this film feels more like a treatise or an essay than a story . the most interesting aspect of the african child is its insight into a culture that most viewers will be unfamiliar with . elements of the african child are fascinating , but few of the best aspects have much to do with baba's brush with adulthood . idrissa ouedraogo's film , the cry of the heart , tells a similar story in a more satisfying fashion -- it has emotional depth to go along with its thematic strength . the african child piques the intellectual centers of the mind , but rarely touches the heart . it works as an examination of the changing nature of life in africa , and as a contrast between cities and underdeveloped villages , but those aims might have been accomplished more effectively in a different , and shorter , medium . 
screenplay : john carpenter , debra hill , kurt russell . director : john carpenter . let's face it , this isn't exactly indiana jones we're talking about -- kurt russell's snake plissken last graced theater screens fifteen years ago in escape from new york , when a significant percentage of today's action film audience was somewhere between puberty and mastering solid food , and that film was not what one would call a classic of the genre . the result is an attempt at self-satire which comes off as a tiresome exercise in pyrotechnics and cheap blue screen effects . it is a good thing carpenter , russell and company waited so long between new york and l . a . , because even those who actually saw the first film probably have forgotten enough not to notice that escape from l . a . is virtually a point-for-point remake of the original . the number of duplicated details is quite astonishing , actually . the twist they try to place on escape from l . a . is that it is supposed to be funnier , almost a parody of the original . i say " supposed to " because john carpenter may be one of the most humorless directors of the last twenty years , taking even bizarre material like big trouble in little china and deadening it with his brooding style . his idea of a joke in escape from l . a . is showing every possible southern california landmark ( hey , it's universal studios ! . . . hey , it's the queen mary ! ) or making a quick reference to every possible stereotype of los angeles living , and to show that he isn't taking anything seriously with some low-tech special effects , including a computer-generated submarine voyage which makes tron look positively state-of-the-art . a few of the gags are clever , like a shot at l . a . 's front-running sports fans ; others can't find a comfortable place between gruesome and silly , like a gang of cosmetic surgery victims always in search of fresh body parts . escape from new york was overly somber , but it was lean and efficient and quite good at creating its desolate urban landscape . there are a few simple pleasures to be found in the performances , including kurt russell's laconic snake . it's one of the best ( if unintentional ) jokes that despite the fact that everyone in the world seems to know who snake plissken is , he has probably been able to escape capture because he has no discernible personality . russell does a guttural clint eastwood impression , and makes a solid anti-hero . snake may be back , but he doesn't have much to say , and what he does have to say has been said before . 
the replacements , a surprisingly funny comedy , is inspired by the 1987 professional football players strike . director howard deutch , who has directed films from pretty in pink to the odd couple ii , and writer vince mckewin ( fly away home ) are perhaps an odd choice for a sports comedy , but they have come up with a thoroughly enjoyable piece of entertainment . a good-spirited and energetic film , it flies by with few pretentious moments . only in the occasional serious interludes and in the throw-away romance does its momentum ever sag . " i've seen monkeys at the zoo that were more organized that this , " says o'neil , while shaking his head during the disastrous start of the replacements' first game . you're a never-was . " " you know what separates the winners from the losers , kid ? " falco retorts . with characters that are walking clich ? s , the director doesn't apologize for them and lets us laugh with them and at them . since they are only going to be there a few weeks , the athletes don't take themselves too seriously . ignoring the axiom of the day that only crudeness sells at the theaters , warner brothers offers a pg-13 movie that , even if it has a few raunchy moments , can respectably display the pg-13 label . parents will not be embarrassed that they let their kids see it , which isn't the case with so many of the recent pg-13 releases that once would have been considered a definite r . the film's sexual humor comes from its parody of professional cheerleaders . the auditions are funny but nothing like the game sequences which are hilarious due to the background of most of the new recruits , whose normal jobs includes skills such as lap dancing . they are so " good " that they prove an effective distraction to lure the opposing players' eyes away at a few crucial moments . notting hill's quintessentially unsexy rhys ifans is perfectly cast as a welsh soccer player named gruff . the out-of-shape , chain-smoking gruff is a great place-kicker willing to try 65-yard goals . like the other members of the team , he's also quite funny . unlike so many other recent sports movie , oliver stone's confusingly-edited any given sunday , for example , the editing in the replacements is lucid , and it is easy to follow the action and get involved in the details of the game . it is a fun moment that captures the essence of this sweet little picture . the replacements runs 1 : 54 but seems much shorter . it is rated pg-13 for some crude sexual humor and language and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up . my son jeffrey , age 11 , had a great time watching it . giving it * * * * , he said it was hilarious . he thought the plot was cool and the football was great . he laughed loudly and cheered frequently . 
a modern noir story whose task seems to be to romanticize violence , with the film looking too much , at times , like a tarantino-clone . but there are scenes that are fresh and invigorating , filled with a deadly explosiveness , but somehow the film fails to put it all together to get at what it is trying to unearth from all the gunplay . it looked at that point , that the film would be very energetic , since that scene was so powerful and so crass -- and original . but the filmmaker fell in love with the violence and couldn't control his bad impulses to do the entire film as an exercise in mindless violence . armed with a highly polished script , lots of arty gunfights , and a convoluted , labyrinth story line , more interested in double-crosses and twists in the plot than human feelings , the film turned off on too many dead-ends to fulfill its potential . if you like gunplay done as choreography , as in recent hong kong action films or in sam peckinpah's " the wild bunch , " and films that prefer violence to sex , action to thinking , and films that discard humor for references that film buffs can go bananas over , a film that models itself after classic movies of criminals on-the-run , then you could be on board for this one , at least , more than other viewers who might find this film is not as good as the films it is imitating . parker and longbaugh are the real-life surnames of butch cassidy and the sundance kid . a shapeless story and an unmoving character portrayal of its anti-heroes get in the way of " the way of the gun " for director-writer christopher mcquarrie , who won an academy award for his unusual script in the overrated " the usual suspects . " he has come up with a reasonably intricate script here for his debut film as a director , but it lacks a certain flow and credibility for it to be a bravura debut . there was a stop-and-go flurry in the action causing the story to grow dull , with guns always the answer to whatever the problem , and its situations took on a suspension of disbelief , leaving a huge void onscreen amid the dark ambivalence of the story line . but what was always absorbing was the actors spouting lines that seemed to come out of their mouths in an unnatural manner , yet had a touch of playfulness , as they mugged for the camera . unfortunately , the film doesn't have any touching moments to fall back on and there is no one worth caring about , so in the midst of all the violence , it is fair to ask what is it all about , besides being a parody on such films . the violence and gore that ensues , plus the twists to the story , offer no big surprises . in fact , it almost seems like hundreds of other " b " films , contrary to what the director might think . his role took him in and out of the film , as it didn't seem to matter what he was spouting , he could have been doing the script to another film it wouldn't have mattered , he still was the film's source of charisma even if he was cast in a supporting role . i was amused with his definition of karma , saying karma is just a belief in justice where you don't even get the pleasure of seeing justice in your lifetime . it's an inaccurate definition of karma , but it was one spot in the film that made you think . but basically this is the type of film that gives ammunition to those who are bashing hollywood for its exploitive tendencies to sell violence . in the last third of the film juliette lewis is a bloody mess , having a baby all the characters pretend to have an interest in , even the fatalistic parker becomes concerned about the baby , but while she is having an excruciatingly painful delivery , one of the film's many shoot-outs is taking place . it seemed the film was more interested in the shoot-outs than in getting to anything else to say . the film was pleasing in the most superficial of ways without offering anything to say about the inner workings of the two thugs who are the centerpiece of the film . the camerawork was superb , and even though the gunplay was phony it filled the screen with stylized action scenes that were mindlessly diverting . the film could be viewed as a guilty pleasure for those who realize that the script let them down but the actors came through with flying colors . they got the graphic violence down pat for a few sparkling thrills , and the film showed that violence is so pervasive in society that even a woman gets punched in the nose by the gunmen , which i guess , goes for equality in this film ! a film that has future cult popularity written all over its ambivalent signature , as the violence had an unsettling nature to it that will probably grow on art-house viewers of thrillers who will catch it on video . there is something intangible about this film that is a reflection of present day society and its ever-increasing nihilistic ways . what the film doesn't do , is go beyond exploiting this nihilism . 
starring : liam neeson , ben kingsley , jonathan sagalle , caroline goodall , ralph fiennes , embeth davidtz director : steven spielberg producers : steven spielberg , gerald r . molen , branko lustig screenplay : steven zaillian based on the novel by thomas keneally music : john williams released by amblin entertainment through universal pictures steven spielberg has directed two of 1993's releases . one is the top money maker , and the other has a legitimate shot at winning the best picture oscar . even as fickle as the academy is , i find it hard to believe that spielberg will be overlooked this time . his holocaust tale is simply too good . there have been numerous documentaries and dramatic productions focusing on the holocaust , including a television mini-series which many consider to be the definitive work . as a result , in deciding to film schindler's list , the director set for himself an imposing task . those who see this motion picture will witness spielberg's success . for a while , there is no interest and nothing happens . spielberg elected to film this motion picture in black-and-white , and it's impossible to argue with his decision . having viewed the movie thus , it's impossible to imagine it any other way . director of photography janusz kaminski has made beautiful use of shadow and light . in much the same way that it's cinematic blasphemy to suggest colorizing citizen kane , so it's impossible to imagine schindler's list in anything but black-and-white . that's not to say that there's no color in this movie , but its use is kept to a premium . when color is used , it's noticeable , and spielberg has definite reasons for utilizing it . schindler's list gives us three major stories and a host of minor ones . these are as ghastly and realistic as anything previously filmed , and spielberg emphasizes the brutality of the situation by not pulling punches when it comes to gore . his eventual lament that he couldn't save more is heartbreaking . goeth is a man to despise , but spielberg works carefully to show enough character depth to paint him with narrower brush strokes that show more than a conscienceless monster . in many ways , the smaller stories are the best parts of schindler's list , and these often provide the most lasting images . of course the holocaust images are grim , but scenes of mass graves and exhumed bodies are not unique to schindler's list . while it's impossible to deny their power , potentially more distubing are the instances of callous , individual murder . spielberg doesn't spare his audience when it comes to sudden violence or the dehumanizing factors involved in such events . schindler's list is replete with moments like this . yet despite the grisly background , this movie is essentially a story of triumph in the midst of a monstrous tragedy . not a happy story , to be sure , but one that offers a glimmer of hope . the acting is uniformly excellent ; there's not a bad performance in evidence . this is no sudden reversal of philosophy , but a matter of conscience that slowly dawns on the man . with skill and a keen sense of schindler's character , neeson depicts the metamorphosis from self-centered businessman to crusader . ben kingsley , whose gandhi transfixed audiences years ago , may have the most understated role in the movie . his is not a flashy part , but it's as essential as neeson's to the story , and he plays it with simple sincerity . there's much more that could--and eventually will--be said about schindler's list . this is the kind of movie that's ripe for discussion . not only is the quality of the production high , but the picture is pregnant with meaning and memories . however , at least for now , i've said enough . this is a movie that speaks for itself anyway , with its images being far more eloquent and gut-wrenching than anything i could write . one-hundred ninety five minutes ( the running length of schindler's list ) is a long time , but it's hard to imagine anyone being aware of the time while watching this film . and when the final credits have rolled , this won't be an experience easily shunted aside or forgotten . 
the story has a certain charm to it and a genuineness that shows through in the telling of the story , as it moves seamlessly from comedy into suspense , at the drop of a briefcase . nick veronis makes his debut as actor/writer/director in this very refreshing story . it's also a buddy movie and the buddies all have an affability of their own and seem like the sort of people you would see in real life and not on a hollywood set . the film offers many keen observations about how these young people react to the tight situation they are in , and it examines in an amusing way their life-style and esprit de corps , but the story keeps coming back to jimmy and how he is prepared to do anything to make his film , even if it means stepping on a few toes of some gangsters . this is an energetic film , it has lots of black comedy and incisive dialogue to recommend it to an audience appreciative of indie films . 
set against the backdrop of a decades-old communal bathhouse , the story celebrates the simple pleasures of life , not the least of which being a long soak while kibitzing with your old buddies . the movie opens with a suited gentleman getting quickly cleansed in a fully automated shower , almost exactly like a car wash . this sweet little film charms us with its innocent images while never becoming saccharine . as it explores father-to-son and brother-to-brother relationships , the script and the acting do not have a moment that doesn't ring true . -- one guy cheats . the sweetly innocent times are interrupted by a story that harkens back to an even simpler time still . in a remote mountain region of china , it rains less than once a year we are told . among the many delightful subplots is one concerning a shower singer . he belts out " o solo mio " with foghorn intensity so long as the water flows . the problem with such buildings , points out one of mr . liu's regulars , is that crickets don't go above the ground floor . after watching shower , progress doesn't look quite so sweet anymore . the official reason for its being rated pg-13 is for " language and nudity . " well , excuse me . i don't recall any profanity and the nudity comes from some very discrete glimpses of men's rears in the bath . to lump this in with crude pg-13-rated films like the in crowd and big momma's house is a travesty . consider shower to be a pg film . it should be fine for any kid old enough to be interested in the story and able to read the english subtitles -- the film is in mandarin . 
screenplay : marc lawrence , based on the original screenplay by neil simon . producers : robert evans , robert w . cort , david madden and teri schwartz . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations , drug use ) running time : 88 minutes . the out-of-towners is the sort of film i generally greet with a generous helping of pooh-poohing . it's a remake ( of a neil simon-penned 1970 original which i have never seen ) , it's a vehicle to re-unite two stars of a previous film ( steve martin and goldie hawn , from 1992's housesitter ) , and it's a broad farce cloaked in shallow sentimentality . the out-of-towners often feels like it's working awfully hard to extract its guffaws , yet it still manages to extract its fair share . the comic energy of the three lead performers -- including the incomparable john cleese -- makes this silly trifle something moderately satisfying . it shouldn't be a surprise that the out-of-towners feels derivative , and not just because it's a remake . nearly every element in the film is designed to have the comfort of the familiar , from the pairing of the two stars , to martin's fuming in a planes , trains & automobiles scenario , to hawn's earnest ditziness , to cleese's resurrection of basil fawlty and python-esque cross-dressing . while the script by marc lawrence ( writer of forces of nature , who appears unusually fond of thwarted travel plans as an aphrodisiac ) pauses occasionally so henry and nancy can muse about the nature of their marriage , it's mostly concerned with set-ups for slapstick situations and tirades . at times , those situations and tirades feel forced ; you can practically see hawn and martin screaming to the audience for whoops and applause when they go on their respective rants against someone who gets their goat . at plenty of others , the actors give the old-fashioned farce a kick it rarely gets on screen . even more wonderful is cleese , a comic treasure too rarely seen . he may be able to do smiling misanthropes like his character here in his sleep , but he still sends a charge through the out-of-towners every moment he's on screen . cleese's scenes are reason alone for comedy fans to spend an hour and a half with this film . i do wish the out-of-towners had shown more restraint with its characters , subjecting them to a bit more frustration and a bit less abject humiliation . it's not a subtle film by any stretch of the imagination , but there was enough humor to be found in the performers that we didn't need to see martin taking a hallucinogenic trip with his pants around his ankles . you may find a lot of the out-of-towners familiar and foolish ; you may also find yourself laughing at it in spite of yourself . there's something to be said for the way talented professionals can take predictable material and wring something fresh and funny from it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
" god , i love methamphetamines -- more than life itself , " confesses ex-tv child star francesca lansfield ( sarah jessica parker ) . scott winant , who was one of the directors of the tv series " my so-called life , " directs 'til there was you . filmed by bobby bukowski in shades of pastel , the movie tries hard , too hard , to be a whimsical , romantic comedy . i've never seen winant's television work , but this movie , winant's first theatrical film , arrived doa at the screening , and his direction as well as the disastrous script by winnie holzman were the culprits . i spent most of the movie staring at the screen in disbelief . the dialog is little more than a collection of snippets of meaningless small talk , and the direction is so muddled that it takes quite a while to sort out what is happening and who is who . the bad news is that when the story does become clear , you will not care . midway through the movie , in a scene with gwen's dad ( michael tucker ) , it looks momentarily as if the film will finally get its footing . her dad , who manages to be both funny and the only believable character in the film , bursts gwen's bubble . " i'm going to tell you something important , " he says while munching candy . " i never loved your mother . she was shocked , and so was i , but then the film went right back to its plastic characters and her dad vanished . ( you can almost hear the director screaming , " get him off my set ; he's not whimsical . " ) perhaps most offensive is the story's attitude toward smoking . it is way cool . you half expected to see a joe camel ad in the closing credits . it used after sex and even instead of sex -- complete with heavy , erotic panting . to complement the film's painfully slow pacing , the unrelenting music by terence blanchard and miles goodman has a staccato piano that will begin to feel like water torture . i felt like the music was trying brainwash me into believing the film's drivel through the music's repetitive romantic rhythms , which had all of the charm of a stuck record needle . " surrounded by rude french people should bring us closer together . " with dialog like this why did the producers go forward with this project ? the movie needs a rewrite and a new director . the cast would work if it had reasonable material . 'til there was you runs 1 : 44 . the film is rated pg-13 for language , sexual suggestions and drug references . the picture is remarkably tame and would be fine for kids 10 and over , but why bother ? i recommend you avoid the film , and i give it a single star for a good cast trapped in awful movie . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
andrew bennett's richly melodious narration injects so much honest humor that you'll likely view the movie with dry but sympathetic eyes . " when i look back on my childhood , " the narrator tells us , " i wonder how my brothers and i managed to survive at all . it was , of course , a miserable childhood : the happy childhood is hardly worth your while . the star of the production is poverty itself . and the kids live in filth and muck , although the parents manage to stay fairly clean . this level of destitution , malnutrition and misery makes typical cinematic poverty look downright luxurious in comparison . in a limited role that offers few opportunities , watson is called upon just to endure . watson does it so well that she will likely get her third oscar nomination . the most amazing part of his role is that it's a sympathetic one . and the bond between frank and his dad is genuine and touching . picture postcard ireland makes few guest appearances in the film , which has more in common with fantasia's sorcerer's apprentice segment than a travelogue . michael seresin's fascinating cinematography looks like the film stock was developed in the streets' dirty rainwater , which perfectly reflects the mood of the story . john williams delivers a dramatic score that's a bit over the top at times , but fits in with the dramatic bleakness of the storyline . each is so well cast that it's hard to choose a favorite . all of them portray frank's chief trait -- he's a survivor . far from a perfect film , the script by laura jones and the director , tries to pack in too much material and too many incidents . the director lets his movie drift when it should be kept more tightly focused , and the final cut of the film is easily a half hour too long . still , it possesses an impeccable honesty and humanity that speaks to our hearts and our minds . it is rated r for some profanity , nudity , sexuality and violence and would be fine for most teenagers . 
he considers these episodes to be ernest hemingway-like experiences . with all its fantastic developments and its obscure way to tell a story , the film still remains grounded in reality , accurately picturing the wasteland of suburban life in the 1980s . the charming adrian grenier is appealing to a certain point as the hero who is both naive and adventurous in a self-destructive way . clark gregg plays his role as someone who feels inside like a woman , but who has been a man so long and still looks like one , that there is certain smugness he has that he can be both a man and a woman . but , the story never leaps beyond its startling revelation of a sex change and the devastating reaction it has for his family . it seems to wither towards its climax . when we see him hitting baseballs at a batting range and then beating up someone who makes fun of him , we're into a typical macho hollywood response mode to such problems , and it becomes apparent that this character will remain underdeveloped . the film setups an engaging story but didn't take it anywhere special , as it was a let down after such a fast start and such a promising look at a youngster needing guidance and getting it from such an unlikely source as gregg . you can rest assured , that this offbeat teenager comedy/drama , returns safely back to its genre's teen movie fold by the film's end , and that is its main fault . 
one of the things you've gotta love about hollywood marketing people is their occasional bouts with irony deficiency . if you trusted television advertisements for holy man , you'd probably suspect that it was a raucous eddie murphy comedy where the star spends most of the film mocking and deflating uptight media types . that's because touchstone pictures' marketing department knew it'd have one hellacious time trying to sell holy man for what it really is : a somber , sincere satire-cum-cautionary tale in which eddie murphy , despite his lead billing , generally plays second fiddle to jeff goldblum . the wonderful , awful irony comes from the " message " of holy man . goldblum plays ricky hayman , the programming director for miami-based good buy shopping network . as g's success reinvigorates ricky's career , ricky begins to wonder whether it's more important to be honest with people than to use any means available to sell to them . pretty good gag , huh ? only the joke will be on viewers who expect to have their funny bones tickled , but instead get a nearly two-hour lecture on the evils of consumerism . murphy , meanwhile , gets a few devilish moments of his own -- you know , the ones in the commercials -- but essentially spends the film's running time smiling beatifically and waxing profound on the importance of love and connection with the earth . it's all very well-intentioned , and deadly dull . the sad part is that holy man could have been an effective piece of satire . the script by tom schulman presents g as a latter-day howard beale or chance the gardener unknowingly tapping into some zeitgeist malaise . unfortunately , if you're going to go for network or being there-style stabs at modern media , you need someone a bit more cutting edge at the helm than stephen herek ( the mighty ducks , mr . herek wraps everything in a warm-n-fuzzy package guaranteed not to offend , a pointless perspective for a social satire . even the few token pokes at infomercialism , including cameo pitch-meisters like morgan fairchild , betty white and soupy sales , are too feather-light to amount to much . wasting a chance to savage as ripe a target as home shopping should be a criminal offense . it's similarly criminal wasting the presence of eddie murphy . i understand murphy's recent move toward kinder , gentler , family-friendly roles , since there are only so many ways to play the wise-cracking rebel with the honking laugh . the problem isn't his performance in holy man , which is quite adequate for the minimal work he's actually required to do . the problem is that no matter how hard murphy tries to be a " versatile actor , " he's going to be in trouble with audiences if marketing geniuses keep suckering his fans into watching a murphy they don't really care to see . i'm glad murphy felt strongly enough about holy man's message of integrity to take a chance playing against type , but he could have picked a less tedious vehicle . it's even worse when touchstone makes him look like a certain pot referring to a certain kettle's ebony shading . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
in an inspired bit of casting , julia roberts plays julia roberts in a princess and commoner story titled notting hill . what's amazing is how likable and vulnerable she makes this poor little rich girl . as exquisitely directed by roger michell and smartly scripted by richard curtis , the movie easily transcends its highly contrived setup . this is a comedic romance that makes you fall in love with love . and it's a romantic comedy that produces huge laughs through dialog that relies on wry wit rather than crude humor -- the polar opposite of there's something about mary . for grant , acting's master of awkwardness , playing thacker would seem as natural as it is for roberts to play scott . indeed it is , but both actors rise above roles in which autopilot performances might have sufficed . their chemistry is a joy to behold , and their acting has wonderful subtlety and grace . i know how thacker must have felt . ] " surreal , but nice . " this may already sound like every man's fantasy , and , if you're going to dream , dream big . when she comes over and plants a big kiss on him , i thought it might be a daydream sequence , but it wasn't . " right , no one , " he responds with sad seriousness . " i mean , i'll tell myself sometime , but i won't believe it . " his irritating flatmate spike is played in an over-the-top performance by rhys ifans . spike , with his prominent gold tooth , uncombed hair , scruffy beard and perpetually dirty feet , supplies much of the movie's more outlandish humor . a little of spike can go a long way , which the editor seems , thankfully , to have realized . as you can guess , the acting princess does call the bookshop pauper back . perhaps something simple like tea at the ritz ? i wonder if i could have used some of his questions ? ] >from this point their romance goes on and off . the players take the movie to a level that should not be possible given the triteness of the basic setup . one suspects that if your brother brought julia roberts home to dinner it could well end up just as it does in the movie . think about it . if you've had a relationship with julia roberts , don't you think you'd have a bit of trouble trying to find someone else afterwards ? after scenes that are alternately sweet , funny , humorous , romantic and poignant , the story finally comes to a close . as you realize it's time for the characters to leave , you begin to miss them . coming up with the movie's most energetic moments , he ends it with an exhilarating sequence that dazzles your mind and heart . this happened to me the second i opened the door to exit the theater . a reporter wanted my opinion of the film . pointing out how similar this real life experience was to the scene in the movie , i asked where julia roberts was . he said she was in the lobby waiting for me . life in this case , i am sad to report , did not imitate art . notting hill runs 2 : 03 but feels much shorter . it is rated pg-13 for some sexual situations and a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 11 and up . my son jeffrey , aged 10 , who saw the film back in california , said he really enjoyed it and gave it * * * . he said he laughed a lot . his only complaints were that he didn't understand some of the humor , and he didn't like some of the bad language . 
at various points during disney's the emperor's new groove , it becomes apparent that it could have been a mediocre-at-best piece of animated film-making . here there's a significant lack of detail in the background animation ; over there , a gaping hole where a catchy tune might have buoyed the proceedings ; throughout , a narrative that doesn't exactly set the world on fire . yes , it's all pretty tepid stuff -- and then a character will open his mouth , and set you to giggling uncontrolably . after years of watching its animated features soar on various permutations of stunning visuals , engaging story-telling and memorable songs , disney has finally made a film that succeeds almost exclusively on the strength of its vocal performances . and it does so by a fairly narrow margin . bonding and learning of important lessons ensues . in a way , the whole business is quite beneath disney . much of the emperor's new groove feels cobbled together as an afterthought , as though the real a-team mouseke-thinkers were too busy making fantasia 2000 or figuring out how to promote 102 dalmatians . while the character animation is effective , virtually everything else is about as eye-catching as your typical hanna-barbera background . the progression of the story is bland , with only a couple of really good action set pieces to liven things up . not exactly the stuff of which disney animated " classics " are made , at least until the voice actors get to strut their stuff . david spade provides the perfect petulant , all-about-me vibe for kuzco , though it certainly helps to be in tune with spade's typical caustic sense of humor . as the villainous yzma , eartha kitt growls her role with such delicious malevolence it boggles the mind that she has never been cast as a disney animated villain before . but the real show-stopper is warburton's kronk , one of those essentially decent lunkhead sidekicks who eventually do their evil bosses more harm than good . the part is a familiar one , but warburton delivers his lines with such a combination of deadpan idiocy and absolute sincerity that nearly every syllable out of kronk's mouth is hilarious . screenwriter david reynolds provides some clever dialogue , but it's not nearly as good as the people who bring it to life . the one weak link in the cast is goodman , though it's not really his fault . pacha is as personality-impaired a character as disney has created in a long time for a central role ( okay , probably since pocahontas ) . he's not exactly the hero , not exactly the comic relief -- he's just the big , good-natured guy necessary to move the plot along . considering the relative blandness of the plot itself , there are all kinds of reasons to suspect that the emperor's new groove should have been a dud . congratulations to spade , kitt and warburton -- and to the casting director -- for giving the film the spark the rest of the creative team couldn't quite manage . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
but lugosi couldn't pull it off being a surgeon and ends up in a minor part as the gangster marnay . the gangster red cannon sustains paralysing spinal injuries and is taken to the same hospital as kingsley . " black friday " was fast-paced , had a good cast , and had an interesting story but it could have probably been more interesting if the story wasn't so convoluted . it's a thriller that could have used a few more thrills , suffering mostly from the flat way it was directed . the results are a mixed bag , but there's enough entertainment to be gotten from this b-film , to make it a satisfying watch . 
with its goofy premise , charming stars , and inoffensive humor , i . q . is likely to delight those who frequent movie theaters in search of romantic comedies . anyone who wants a little more from a film won't find it here , however . i . q . is inappropriately titled--cute and lighthearted it may be , but it definitely isn't clever or intelligent . through the first hour , i . q . is pleasant , carried by the chemistry of its leads . ryan , with her wide-eyed gaze and characteristic head tilt , and robbins , with his jimmy stewart-like , low-key style , work well together . it's only in the movie's final third , when an increasingly absurd and disjointed plot surfaces , that the screen presence of the pair is no longer sufficient . matthau is okay as einstein , fitting most people's preconception of a doddering genius . altogether , these intellectual giants act much like the four stooges , and are responsible for a fair share of i . q . 's comedy . fortunately , fry plays his charge as such a stuffed shirt that we don't care . this leads to the film's funniest lowbrow scene--a multiple choice intelligence test with the four old men finding a way for ed to cheat--but it also devolves proceedings to a sit-com level . technical inaccuracies and anachronisms abound , some of which are a little too obvious to miss . how much these annoy the individual viewer will likely depend on how spellbound he or she is by the film's dubious web of magical romance . towards the end of the film , einstein advises catherine , " keep your sense of wonder " and " don't let your brain interfere with your heart . " those , apparently , are mottoes director fred schepisi hopes his audience will bear in mind when watching i . q . the reason is obvious : thinking is not the way to get the most out of this uneven picture . the above represents the opinions of the author , and not necessarily those of bellcore or any organization within bellcore . 
and she didn't just say it , she almost panted it . wearing a tight , low-cut pastel sweater , she was not a woman you'd want to refuse . watch out for people with such false modesty . ) well not exactly . but , as the press notes aptly say , " nothing is 'that' easy . " set in the bright florida sun , palmetto may not look like a film noir , but it is firmly routed in that genre . frequent thunder without rain means the characters sweat profusely in the thick humidity . although several of the plot elements are easy to predict , many aren't . the excellent actor woody harrelson gives a surprisingly self-controlled and almost pensive performance . ( " i was in it right up to my ears , and no idea how i was going to get myself out . " ) woody takes a more subtle approach to the role that he typically has to others . the result is a character who seems quite genuine . " i tried writing but nothing comes out , " harry tells us in voice-over . " there's nothing worse than a writer who has nothing to say . " well screenwriter e . max frye's adaptation of james hadley chase's novel , " just another sucker , " has a lot to say . although little of it breaks any new ground , the movie by german director volker schlondorff thoroughly entertains . you won't feel cheated like harry . and you'll get your money's worth as the twists and surprises accelerate as the movie races to its conclusion . palmetto runs 1 : 52 . it is rated r for sex , violence and profanity and would be fine for mature teenagers . 
the trigger effect , a psychological thriller from david koepp , opens with an image of coyotes tearing at a dead carcass . it's a visceral , unsettling scene , and you'd have to be more than a little dense not to figure out that it's a metaphor . and , while this film admittedly has its share of problems , it at least does a better job of achieving that goal than this year's adaptation of the h . g . wells story . to the extent that the trigger effect is intended as a tense , somewhat nerve-wracking thriller , it's adequate , and certainly better than the formula-driven likes of the hand that rocks the cradle . first- time director koepp , working with tips from steven spielberg and brian de palma ( koepp co-wrote jurassic park and mission impossible , and was able to call on the directors of those films for advice ) , handles the material smoothly . the flaws lie mainly in the script that writer koepp gave himself to direct . the premise is as intriguing as it is timely : what if some freak occurrence caused a massive , perhaps country-wide , blackout ? there's no electricity , telephones don't work , and no tv or radio stations are on the air . no one understands what's happening . the specter of anarchy looms . the trigger effect's most serious problem is that , while the tension is palpable , the setup generating it feels contrived . once we settle into koepp's plot , the story is solid enough to keep our interest , but it's difficult to plow through all the artificiality that burdens the film's early scenes . the characters seem like creations of the moment ; we have no sense of their history , and we certainly don't like them -- they're irritating and self-centered . it's as if they didn't exist before first appearing on screen . too much of the interpersonal strife between matt , annie , and joe seems manufactured , and , since it doesn't feel natural , it damages our ability to accept the trio as human beings rather than products of a writer's imagination . ultimately , the trigger effect is about how people react when driven by desperation , and , to a lesser extent , how humanity has come to rely too heavily on technology . there are times when these themes are hammered home a little too zealously , but , unlike in the island of dr . moreau , we're spared a sermon . heavy-handed symbolism and obvious metaphors are as far as the trigger effect goes . once koepp has brought us through the awkward setup , things improve dramatically . at times , koepp's vision is almost post-apocalyptic , which gives the film a dark , paranoid edge . the reason for the blackout is never explained , which is probably a good thing -- the film works better with the cause left as a matter of conjecture . had koepp fashioned better- rounded characters with a more believable central conflict , the trigger effect could have been an outstanding example of high-energy , thought- provoking cinema . however , as it is , it's more intriguing than memorable , and worthwhile only to those with the patience to sit through a dissatisfying and uneven first half-hour . 
if you like your 007s as dry as a dry martini , this may be the bond for you . the mundane visuals fit right in with the bland storyline . where are the signature chase scenes , the sexual humor and the romantic trysts that we come to bond films for in the first place ? here the chase scenes are mainly saved until the end . dalton's reaction ? the old james sought out such opportunities without being coerced . dalton is dead serious , having little time to waste on women or humor . a white-suited wayne newton , providing some much needed humor , appears in a cameo as a televangelist on the prowl for donations . after a languid and completely formulaic movie , the pace finally picks up at the end in a long chase scene using large gasoline trucks . when the only memorable visual is a semi doing a wheelie , you know the picture is in trouble . it is rated pg-13 for profanity and violence and would be fine for kids around 9 and up . my son jeffrey , age 9 , thought the movie was just okay . he gave it * * and complained that it was too bloody . 
sad to say , most wanted is yet another poorly-executed government conspiracy thriller , joining the lackluster ranks of shadow conspiracy , murder at 1600 , and conspiracy theory . most wanted is intended as a vehicle for keenan ivory wayans , action hero ( as opposed to keenan ivory wayans , talented comic ) . but , while wayans the actor has an undeniable screen presence , wayans the writer lets him down . not only is the screenplay for most wanted laughably absurd , but it contains line after line of the worst dialogue available in any film currently on a multiplex screen . yet the film makers still expect us to take most wanted seriously . in general , action films are not known for their intelligence , but this one takes assumptions of the audience's stupidity a little too far . for a movie this dimwitted to succeed , it has to keep viewers under a constant barrage of pyrotechnics , gunfire , chases , and other assorted thrills . it can't allow them a moment's pause to actually think . inexplicably , this is not first time director david glenn hogan's approach . so , although the action sequences are all well-choreographed , there are significant pauses between them . the film makers have foolishly inserted exposition into those dead zones , and the more we learn about the conspiracy underlying most wanted , the more we realize it would be better left unexplained . the movie opens with an offer . it's supposed to be a clean , quick operation , but it doesn't go that way . the conspiracy here has many levels , and the more diligently you try to figure out exactly what's going on , the more apparent it becomes how ludicrous the entire scheme is . most wanted features some adequate action sequences , but nothing that can suitably camouflage the weakness of the plot . wayans does the best he can with the role , but he only has himself to blame for its limitations . jon voight , who lately seems to be choosing roles that allow him to chew the scenery ( check out anaconda and u-turn for other examples ) , goes at it full-throttle here , recalling images of james woods and donald sutherland at their most over-the-top . jill hennessy ( a smile like yours ) is bland but attractive as dunn's hostage-turned-sidekick . and paul sorvino's quietly dignified performance is completely wasted . i'm getting bored of dumb action movies , and there have been far too many of them this year . when i go into a theater to see explosions and shootouts , i don't look for a script that resembles shakespeare , but i expect it to make sense and keep my attention . most wanted does neither . it's a poor excuse for entertainment , and , in the wake of the glimmer man , this has me seriously wondering about keenan ivory wayans' choice of motion picture material . " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
the story might be slight , but the acting by tritignant is just right and the action scenes keep coming and are perfectly executed . scheider also stands out in a supporting role . this flick is all about shootouts and quirky character portrayals , like the one of the housewife talking nonstop to the press about her ordeal and eating up the fact that she's on tv . 
screenplay : cameron crowe . director : cameron crowe . cameron crowe's almost famous -- the writer/director's first film since 1996's jerry maguire -- tallies up its first simple yet thoroughly inspired moment just seconds into the film , during the opening credits . in a cute conceit connected to the story's protagonist , a 15-year-old aspiring music journalist , we see a hand scrawling out the cast on a yellow pad with a pencil . not a line of dialogue had been spoken , and already i was hooked . to crib a line from crowe's last film , almost famous had me at hello . crowe has helmed only four films in his career -- say anything , singles , jerry maguire and now almost famous -- but i'm tempted to call him america's most effortlessly gifted film-maker . there's nothing particularly profound about a coming-of-age story with a rock 'n' roll backdrop , nor does there need to be . crowe isn't a " statement " kind of guy , and it doesn't seem to hurt his films in the least . almost famous simply drops us into the world of rock in the early '70s , and lets us observe through william's wide eyes . like crowe's other films , this one seems to amble along in no particular hurry to get anywhere , giving the characters lots of room to maneuver , yet never feels unfocused or uninvolving . occasionally the loose structure gets in the way , as it does when crowe fails to provide enough foundation for stillwater's burgeoning popularity either through their music or through their performances . far more often , the moment-to-moment experience is too enjoyable for anyone to notice . in large part , that moment-to-moment pleasure comes from crowe's uncanny ability to direct actors . as he has in his previous films , he puts together a solid cast and makes magic . mcdormand , though she remains a too-mannered performer at times , is still entertaining as william's intense mother ; fugit is likeable and innocent in a way that's never bland ; hoffman is yet again is so good you just want to throttle hollywood for not allowing him to be a star . like william , penny only fools herself into thinking it's ever about the music ; though she creates herself as a sort of muse , she's just looking to fill an empty space with rock 'n' roll's mythology of freedom . penny is the story's anchor , and hudson's facial expressions are so perfect they're heartbreaking . as deftly as crowe handles his story , there are still occasional missteps . those tics and a few others like it might have been more damaging in another film , made by another film-maker , but almost famous just seems to absorb its flaws and roll on . there's something almost hypnotic about the grace with which cameron crowe puts a film together , something that produces winner after winner . it's not a life-changing experience , not a clockwork plot or a joke-a-minute script . it's just the pleasure of watching a director who can suck you in with the brush of an eraser . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
melville establishes his exquisite control of the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect manner . i suspect , not many directors have that kind of grace and understanding of life . . . melville's sense of how to tell a story has influenced many directors through his long career starting in the late 40s , and that list would include the great director , bresson , who developed the same style and feel for filmmaking as melville , who at times outdoes melville's melville , giving some the false impression that melville imitated bresson . melville's success comes through the intelligent use he makes of his eye for seeing what is spiritual and what is intelligent , and allowing it to be emotionally compelling . his argument for a god couldn't be put forth with more verve and intelligence , even though it didn't convince me , as he was not challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the ability to present a cogent differing opinion , nevertheless , this film moved me to further expand what i think . . . it even shows that it is possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church , something that i have rarely come across outside the cinema . 
touch is a film about healing through stigmata . for those of you like myself who recognize the word but have no idea what it means , the movie's information kit defines it as " a spontaneous manifestation of bloody wounds on a person's hands , feet , and side , similar to wounds of the crucified jesus christ . " with this much information you probably figure touch is another movie from some religious order . schrader is a director who likes his material on the edge . as you can now guess , schrader approaches touch in ways that other directors might not . although touch does have its moments , i spent most of the movie as confused as the actors . as occasional nervous laughter crept into what was otherwise an unusually silent press screening , i kept asking myself : was this line supposed to be funny ? are we laughing with the show or at it ? most of the actors were confused as to whether they were in a serious film or a comedy . others seemed to feel they were in a parody . many scenes were quite enjoyable , and yet . . . perhaps it was the movie's beginning that turned me off . any show that starts with someone throwing objects at a television screen because he does not like what is playing puts my cliche meter immediately into the red zone . skeet ulrich's acting makes the picture . you are never sure what he is going to do next , and he has the innocence of a true faith healer . his goatee and overall appearance are meant to remind the audience of jesus without trying to copy some religious picture exactly . walken and fonda are great actors and watching them pull off these ambiguous roles was one of the delights of the film . and juvenal can confess to her , " i bleed from five wounds and heal people , but i've never been in love . " touch bogs now more than you would expect from a paul schrader film . in one long scene , for example , walken and fonda are forced to sit around making small talk . walken is better doing something creepy , and fonda seems too intelligent to bother with this meaningless banter . easily the weakest character in the film , tom arnold gets large amounts of screen time as august murray , the head of a protest movement within the roman catholic church . arnold's performance borders on the embarrassing . the movie is full of known actors . a director and an actor , mazursky has had mixed success with both careers . here he is the most wasted of all of the actors . davidovitch acts with great gusto in what is a part so small that it would have vanished without her energy . garofalo takes her few lines and makes them special by her mere presence . " controversy is my oxygen , " lusanna says . " it's the air i breathe . " gershon's acting abilities appear limited to large smiles . an off-beat show , certainly . and sometimes , an interesting one . but too much of its far out humor just doesn't work . touch runs just 1 : 37 . it is rated r . there is some male and female nudity , a little sex , a little violence , and a few cuss words . perhaps it was the sacrilegious aspects that got it the r , but i would have expected the film to have gotten a pg-13 . the show would be fine for any teenager and perhaps those just a bit younger if they can understand the humor in the material . i liked parts of the show especially some of the acting , but cannot bring myself to recommend it . i give it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
starring : macaulay culkin , ted danson , glenne headly , saul rubinek , gailard sartain , hector elizando director : howard deutch producers : katie jacobs and pierce gardner screenplay : tom s . parker and jim jennewein cinematography : tim suhrstedt music : miles goodman released by mgm more often than not , the missing adult is the father , and the effect of his absence is rarely positive , and occasionally profound . getting even with dad would like potential viewers to believe that it puts a " positive spin " on this issue . actually , the dysfunctional family in this film is little more than a shameless plot device to introduce a lame father/son bonding adventure . the premise of getting even with dad is vaguely reminiscent of that of the vastly superior american heart , a 1993 release with jeff bridges in the lead role . american heart delivers everything that this film doesn't : a solid plot , impressive acting , and a hard look at the complex dynamics of a fragmented father/son relationship - not to mention the pressures on an ex-con trying to make it outside prison walls . getting even with dad wouldn't know real sentiment or believable character development if it stumbled upon either . just to make sure that the audience accepts this film as a lighthearted ( and light-headed ) romp , two bumbling crooks--bobby and carl--have been included ( sound a little like another culkin film ? ) . most of the time , however , the pair proves to be more annoying than amusing , with almost every attempt at a gag executed with dubious aptitude . the problem is , with two such flat characters , how can any interaction between them be meaningful ? these are only some of the issues that the filmmakers didn't want to address . need i mention that getting even with dad has a happy ending ( guess what happens ) ? anyone who thinks i'm giving something away with that statement has the wrong idea about the film's nature and intent . as bereft of intelligence as the movie is , i suppose it's amiable enough , and likely to be enjoyed by children ( many of whom will have no trouble relating to the actions of 11-year old tim ) . that my attention was so arrested by the less-than-exemplary score should be an adequate comment about how noteworthy the rest of the production is . 
happiness is not a film about happiness , because happiness is not real but imagined , therefore no one can stay happy in a world where sadness is the more prevalent emotional state . so goes the theme of this dark comedy , meant to shock and antagonize you into looking at people you cannot readily identify with , in a film that features a pedophile rapist ( dylan ) , a murderer ( camyrn ) , an obscene caller ( hoffman ) , a masturbator ( read ) , a russian immigrant thief ( jared ) , and an assortment of losers and lonely people wrapped up in their egos , as solondz's morbid sense of humor turns to new jersey's suburbs to explore the depravity of the human race . this is an honestly made film that refuses to compromise on its plot or who should be cast in it ( solondz refused the studio's offer to cast the pedophile with a noted star such as , william hurt , because he felt dylan was just right for the role ) . this film is meant for an art house type of audience , one that is able , as difficult as it may be , to see something in themselves in the characters portrayed on screen . i would wonder about anyone who could sit through this film and not be disturbed by it , that would just defeat its purpose . the audience i saw this film with , were mostly williams college students and faculty , and they laughed openly and freely at the parts that had an edge to it , where solondz was going for the laugh because he pushed the button as far as he wanted to go with a certain character and , in order to return to the intensely grim psychological mood of the story , he had to release some humorous energy or have the film drown in its own murky waters . the laughter was appropriate , and even " hip , " as it felt right to see this with an audience that still felt the need to be entertained when they go to the movies , and it didn't seem to matter if the laughter came about from the cruel humor it evoked , causing people to react as a group rather than individually . i found that most people in the audience appeared to be nervously silent ; and , there was at no time just one person alone laughing ( but , the best part , is that only one person walked out of the theater and no one hissed ) . happiness is a difficult picture to watch , there are no good guys or gals . the sisters all suffer from ego-centredness , and it takes an audience with a modicum of sympathy for each of them to get past all the vices each of them has , as each one in this story only pretends to be interested in anyone but themselves . this is a very solid film , that is well-acted , that is understandably not for everyone , yet because it takes risks on subjects that are tabu , and even though some of the risks seemed contrived and not a part of the natural story line , this is still a powerful film , one deserving of attention and intelligent critique , one deserving of thanks from those of us who welcome a true effort for the sake of art , even if the art has to sink into the mud to have its story told . many filmmakers have approached the subject of happiness by tacking on a happy ending to their films . that is not the case with this film , obviously . this film leaves you little choice , you can take this film as morbid and amusing as it is , or you can ignore it , or you can find no one in it that you feel some sort of compassion for , and therefore come to hate it . i came close to loving it , while not exactly loving it , mainly because there were too many scenes in it that left me with mixed feelings and messages . but close to loving it , means i liked it a lot for its honesty to subject matter and character . i did , however , think that these characters went too far in their portrayals for me to relate to them without either feeling sorry for them or despising them . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net 
bobby , whose recent films include the yugo story , is a no nonsense filmmaker . kit will never know he's in the movie , and most of chubby rain's cast and crew don't know that kit doesn't know . the inventive and resourceful bobby has an answer for every problem . need some lighting for a shot ? steve martin's script is a classic bit of comedic writing with a long list of memorable lines . the most amazing part of the script is that it gets laughs the old-fashioned way without benefit of flatulence jokes , bathroom humor or bodily fluids . the movie deliciously skewers tinseltown . bobby reveals such secrets as the fact that every movie costs exactly $2 , 184 -- which is what he has saved away . " but , i'm not from ohio . " she takes what could be a slightly sleazy part and turns it into a sweet and charming one instead . murphy shows an acting dexterity and a risk-taking openness that's impressive . jiff blushes or cries , not as an act , but because he's embarrassed or scared . " would you be willing to cut your hair ? " " yes , but it's usually better if someone else does it , " jiff replies sincerely , missing the point of the question entirely . he does have movie experience ; he says that he's a frequent renter at blockbuster . as the movie advances towards a climax worthy of chariots of fire , the energetic pacing reaches fever pitch . in a sort of epilogue , we get to glimpse bobby's next movie , which is so outrageously bad that an uncontrollable fit of laughter is the most likely response . bowfinger and both of the movies within it are thoroughly satisfying . even if they charged you for all three , it would be worth the triple admission price . it is rated pg-13 for sex-related material and language and would be fine for kids 10 and up . my son jeffrey , age 10 , thought the movie was hilarious and gave it a full * * * * . 
starring : rade serbedzija , katrin cartlidge , gregoire colin director : milcho manchevski screenplay : milcho manchevski cinematography : manuel teran music : " anastasia " released by gramercy pictures in macedonian , english , and albanian with subtitles as well as being a repeated line in before the rain , this statement clarifies director milcho manchevski's perspective . the structure of the movie is non-chronological with the conclusion actually occurring about forty minutes into the film . manchevski , directing his first major feature following a string of music videos , presents his message with a sublime intensity that eludes the film world's oliver stones . before the rain isn't explicitly about bosnia , but it goes a long way towards explaining the " whys " of what's happening there . the film is as rich in symbols as in narrative . circles are everywhere , and water takes on its age-old meaning of purification . if there's one weakness in before the rain , it's that despite an ambitious story , beautiful cinematography , convincing acting , and a powerful message , character development is surprisingly feeble . part of the problem is undoubtedly the odd structure of the plot , but even aleksandar , who has more screen time than anyone else , seems a little hollow . there are instances when he's more the mouthpiece of a philosophy than a unique individual . this is indicative of before the rain's most apparent flaw : that manchevski occasionally lets the " art " of his production obscure its emotional impact . the visceral effectiveness of before the rain is undeniable--it brings home the global reality of violence without ever glorifying or glamorizing it . the film is loaded with chilling little touches of how this particular circle has trapped humanity . as " words " reminds us , communications problems are often more fundamental than language differences . in manchevski's world , when peace exists , it's an exception , and redemption is perhaps a futile gesture . 
the obvious question associated with the creation of home alone 3 is " why , " though not for the obvious reasons . you'd certainly expect a third installment from a series where the first two racked up a collective $457 million , even if the star of those two films has been spending more time lately in court than on screen . it's just that home alone guru john hughes has been doing a perfectly serviceable job of re-cycling that successful formula without using the home alone name . baby's day out , 101 dalmatians and flubber have managed to turn pratfalls , scatology and groin injuries into cash without conjuring up the yelping visage of macaulay culkin . why indeed , especially if you're going to fumble the formula the way home alone 3 does . the required elements appear to be in place -- a youngster ( alex d . linz as alex pruitt ) , absentee parents , a snow-covered midwestern suburb , nefarious intruders , several severe bodily injuries and property damage in the six-figure range -- but everything feels just slightly askew . and the direction by raja gosnell , taking over for chris columbus , drags the pace so badly during the first hour that kids may be snoring long before they chuckle for the first time . now , no one has ever accused me of championing john hughes' modus operandi in the 90s , when he lost all interest in films for viewers over the age of 10 . in fact , i'm pretty sure it's one of the biblical signs of the end-times . but let's face it -- the formula works . home alone 3 includes all of hughes' most annoying habits -- cloying sentimentality , utter disdain for adults , crotch-level comedy -- with little of the mitigating frivolousness . the road runner turns into a rhodes scholar , wile e . coyote into a james bond villain , and the trip-hammer pacing something more suited to merchant ivory than chuck jones . of course , i can't recall a merchant ivory film which included so many different things dropped on people's heads . the villains in home alone 3 are brained from above with books , barbells , decorative flower pots , a lawn mower , lumber and human excrement , among other things , which nick glennie-smith's relentlessly whimsical score reminds us is jolly good fun . certainly all the mayhem will keep the kids giggling , assuming you rouse them from their naps , but there are so many different ways to see exactly the same material with more energy and at significantly less cost . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
lasting almost a decade , this cultural indoctrination was , one assumes , supposed to purge any remaining remnants of bourgeois thought from these intellectuals . the threadbare script by chen and geling yan is based on yan's novel . when the camera has nothing else to do , it points itself to the sky giving us so many cloud sequences that the picture could just as aptly be titled the clouds . the movie starts off promisingly . the lovely chinese actress lu lu plays xiu xiu with an assured grace and a delicate style . noting the raw and inferior quality of toilet paper xiu xiu is likely to encounter , her mother has traded her sugar rations for a large supply of good quality toilet paper . ( this " good " paper looks as rough as cheap paper towels in an american restroom . ) at this point we expect the depiction of xiu xiu's life to show it to be harsh and inhospitable . chen stages scenes for maximum gloss and has xiu xiu made up to look glamorous . this works at cross proposes to what one assumes is chen's intent . the widely acclaimed to live , which covers much of the same ground , makes the tragic scenes as genuine as the joyful ones . chen coats the traumatic moments with the same slick veneer she uses on the lighter ones , thus muting any effect they have on the audiences . the film's actors give everything asked and more . and cinematographer yue lu makes the film too gorgeous for its own good . if you don't watch yourself , you'll be wishing they had inducted you . chen makes living out under the wide and starry sky look pretty appealing . when you leave , you'll undoubtedly think of the beautiful and tranquil xiu xiu with wildflowers dancing all around her . that will likely be the memory that remains , not her tragic moments . the film is in mandarin with english subtitles . it is rated r for strong sexual content and some profanity and would be fine for older teenagers . 
starring : kim vithana , jimmi harkishin , sarita khajuria , mo sesay , lalita ahmed , shaheen khan director : gurinder chadha producer : nadine marsh-edwards screenplay : meera syal cinematography : john kenway music : craig pruess , john altman , and kuljit bhamra released by first look pictures bhaji on the beach not only examines this cross-cultural conflict , but looks at sexism and the generation gap , as well . there are so many stories that it's sometimes difficult to keep up with each one , especially in the beginning , when the characters are being introduced . if there's an obvious failing in chadha's work , it's that she's too ambitious . she has a lot to say and , apparently , wants to say it all in one movie . the result is a controlled chaos that can , upon occasion , become confusing . there are other characters , as well . throughout much of the movie , chadha keeps the tone light--a demanding task considering the amount of material she's juggling . the final fifteen minutes , which include an overload of melodrama and a shocking display of violence , are not as well directed as the previous eighty-five , and the mood is at variance with what came before . like her creative idol , ken loach , the director attempts to blend gritty realism with natural comedy , but her success is qualified . she has an accurate grasp of the little details of life , but sometimes the broader strokes elude her . for the most part , the characters are richly drawn , and this helps to maintain balance among the different stories . there aren't sequences in bhaji on the beach where the action bogs down because we're waiting for the focus to shift . admittedly , certain subplots , such as hashida's relationship with oliver , are better-presented than others , but nothing stands out as being obviously superior . there's a line of dialogue in bhaji on the beach that sums up the film : " it's not often that we women get away from the patriarchal demands made on us in our daily lives , struggling under the double yoke of racism and sexism . " when simi says this , she does so with a broad smile . it's a serious statement , but not one ponderously made . and that seems to be chadha's view of filmmaking : explore themes , but let the philosophical issues blend into the story , not dominate it . if she continues to abide by this creed , it may not take many more films before she's turning out pictures to rival loach's riff-raff and raining stones . 
featuring robert crumb , charles crumb , maxxon crumb , aline kominsky- crumb , robert hughes , and others director : terry zwigoff producers : lynn o'donnell and terry zwigoff cinematography : maryse alberti music : david boeddinghaus u . s . distributor : sony pictures classics upon viewing the completed version of this film , cartoonist robert crumb , whose story it tells , informed director terry zwigoff , " after i saw it i had to go for a walk in the woods , just to clear my head . i took my favorite hat off , this hat that i've had for 25 years , and i threw it off a cliff . i don't want to be r . crumb anymore . " considering the material , the reaction is understandable . this is the sort of movie capable of prompting a viewer to question and evaluate a great deal more than the inner workings of a single man . in addition to presenting one of the most compelling filmed documentary character studies of all time , crumb asks a lot of pointed questions about life and art that no one can possibly answer , least of all the misanthropic genius at the center of the portrait . " my work is full of sweating , nervous uneasiness , which is a big part of me and everybody else , " says crumb . " most people don't want to see that though , because it reminds them of inadequate parts of themselves . " indeed , one of the most fascinating aspects for any viewer of crumb is to identify elements of their own personality reflected in what zwigoff uncovers . crumb doesn't tone down his often-bizarre opinions just because the camera is on . crumb , made with even-handed passion by zwigoff , does not attempt to be a complete chronicle of the cartoonist's life . instead , the movie chooses to examine certain facets of his personality , his and others' impressions of his work , and the forces which contributed to the genesis of a product that has been called everything from satirical genius to pornographic filth . but , as deep as his bitterness runs , the artist possesses a streak of sardonic , self-deprecating humor that shines through . at one point , crumb states , " at least i hate myself as much as i hate anybody else . " is crumb a misogynist ? but there's more than that to his work . it's even suggested that putting such fantasies on paper is " dangerous . " zwigoff gives both sides of the argument equal time , and never editorializes . it's up to the viewer to decided which position , if either , he or she accepts . no doubt . realized i was an outcast , i became a critic , and i've been disgusted with american culture from the time i was a kid . i started out by rejecting all the things that the people who rejected me liked , then over the years i developed a deeper analysis of these things . " whatever opinion a viewer has of crumb at the end of this film , an apathetic reaction is unthinkable . empathy , fascination , disgust , or anger are all likely , but not disinterest . r . crumb is the sort of person it's impossible to ignore , and zwigoff's film creates such an honest portrayal of him that some sort of response is demanded . crumb is a rare and powerful documentary that completely absorbs the viewer and leaves an impression so blindingly clear that the afterimage cannot be blinked away even when the theater is far behind . crumb and his words will tug at the mind with all the tenacity of a pit bull tearing at its prey . 
it's quite possible to argue that jack nicholson is among the ten best actors working today . some of his performances , like those in chinatown and the shining ( for example ) , are classics . the star's latest , blood and wine , continues this unfortunate trend -- nicholson is good , but the movie isn't . analyzed purely from a plot perspective , there's nothing terribly wrong with blood and wine . it's an unremarkable noir thriller with a few twists that , despite being telegraphed too early , keep the story moving . as involved as that all sounds , there are two reasons why it doesn't make for interesting drama . in the first place , huge chunks of blood and wine seem recycled . blood and wine has rare , isolated bursts of energy , but , for the most part , it comes down to fist fights , predictable betrayals , and car chases . the second flaw is more detrimental , however . one key to a good thriller is fashioning interesting characters . they don't have to be likable -- reservoir dogs was populated by a bunch of no-good thugs and killers -- but they have to grab and hold the audience's attention . no one in blood and wine is able to do that . this film contains a group of unappealing , banal personalities . even nicholson , who displays all of his usual charming , cynical mannerisms , can't redeem alex -- there's not enough there for the actor to work with . michael caine has fun playing the amoral victor , savoring one of his most interesting roles in some time . victor's motto , which adequately describes his personality , is that " there's no such thing as honor among thieves . it's a myth . " would that the same could be said of stephen dorff , whose sour , one-note performance becomes wearisome before the end of the first reel . blood and wine's director , bob rafelson , has previously made five movies with nicholson , including 1970's memorable five easy pieces . as an attempt to recapture past glory , this picture falls considerably short of the mark . there are instances when fully-realized characters can save a tired plot , and times when a snappy , well-executed storyline can cover up for ill-developed personalities . unfortunately , blood and wine has neither . to give the film credit , it does possess a certain , dark style , but all the atmosphere in the world can't fill the holes left by the screenplay . blood and wine develops a lot less than we expect from it , and leaves us wondering when jack nicholson will next tackle a role worthy of his reputation . 
starring : joseph gordon-levitt , danny glover , christopher lloyd , brenda fricker , tony danza director : william dear producers : irby smith , joe roth , and roger birnbaum screenplay : dorothy kingsley , george wells , and holly goldberg cinematography : matthew f . leonetti music : randy edelman released by walt disney pictures hc : hello , and welcome back to the ballpark . i'm your play-by-play announcer harry canary , and joining me in the broadcast booth for today's game is our guest color man , james berardinelli . can i call ya jim ? jb : no . hc : okay , jim . if you don't mind my saying , you seem a little on the grumpy side today . care to share with the listening audience why ? jb : take a look who's coming up to bat , and you'll understand . hc : that would be our first hitter of the day , the new walt disney movie angels in the outfield . from the same company that made the lion king . jb : hard to believe . any time disney tries their hand at live action , though , the results are usually pretty poor . just not this bad . hc : so , angels in the outfield stands in the box . i have to admit , jim , it doesn't look too good from where i'm sitting . jb : yeah . check out the premise . so , naturally , roger starts praying for that . hc : well , as bad as this film may look on the surface , let's see how it performs on the field . and here's the first pitch . . . boy that one really had angels in the outfield fooled . it didn't have any idea where the ball was headed . jb : that's not the only thing it doesn't have any idea about . for a baseball movie , the script shows an amazing lack of fundamental knowledge about the game . every sports aficionado knows that the " injured reserve list " is not a baseball term . in this sport , it's called the " disabled list . " such simple , basic mistakes rankle . and there are lots of them . hc : well , at least angels in the outfield gets the clubhouse spirit right , doesn't it ? jb : no . this is somebody's idea of what it might be like in a rowdy clubhouse , and bears no resemblance to anything real . sure , the film is basically a fantasy , but its depiction of the reality it wants to be grounded in is ludicrous . hc : okay . well , the pitcher's in his windup , and here's the second pitch to angels in the outfield . and this movie's in the hole , oh-and-two . jb : it's in a deeper hole than that . there's so much wrong that it will be difficult to cover everything in the course of a single at-bat . jb : take the ending . it's so sweet , it makes you want to gag . then there's the film's view on religion . the screenwriters want to use angels--which are spiritual creatures by nature--but they don't want to offend anyone , so they come up with some namby-pamby , broad , meaningless definition of god and his or her minions . hc : sounds pretty weak to me . jb : then there's the acting . suffice it to say that tony danza gives one of the most " impressive " performances , and young joseph gordon- levitt has serious credibility problems . danny glover looks embarrassed . hc : forgive me for asking this , but why bother going to a movie that's this bad ? i mean , you obviously couldn't have known for sure beforehand , but the previews look pretty dumb . jb : i always like to give baseball movies a chance . every once in a while , something decent comes along , like eight men out . hc : okay . well , the pitcher's back into his windup , and here's the next pitch . swing and a miss . and angels in the outfield is outta there on three straight strikes . jb : no more than it deserves , and if i have to sit through another bad baseball movie , i'll . . . maybe you can give us a word or two on that film , jim . take it easy . uh oh . somebody warn the projectionist !

it is a small negligence on alice's part not to watch the child for just a few moments , but it has cataclysmic consequences . it tears alice's already miserable life asunder . elliott , who sometimes lets his movie meander , stages the scene of the child's death with particular poignancy . the ending of this scene will literally tear your heart out , and , yet , the way it is presented is completely natural and unmanipulative . no , not about the drowning . this entire episode has chilling parallels with recent , well-publicized cases of massive , false child abuse complaints . weaver , who is in most of the scenes , makes the picture rise above the ordinary . willing to look quite unattractive and to play a remarkably unsympathetic character , she gives a frightening picture of someone on the verge of losing it all in more ways than one . in an otherwise hard hitting film with conspicuous ambiguity , the ending wraps things up a bit too neatly . but after you leave the theater , you'll quickly forget the film's few shortcomings . you'll be thinking instead about weaver's strong performance as a woman on the edge . it is rated r for some sexuality and language and would be fine for most teenagers . 
operation condor , originally released in hong kong as armor of god ii , is something of an odd choice to release , since all die hard chan fans are likely already familiar with it ( it's available on video ) . all indications are that the distributor wanted to put out a jackie chan movie this summer , and settled upon something that was cheap and readily available . as far as plot goes , this film , like many of the action superstar's efforts , is decidedly silly and disjointed , often bordering on incoherent . any chan storyline is , after all , just a flimsy excuse to permit the leading man to perform a number of amazing stunts , engage in astonishing martial arts fights , and present a series of hilarious comedy bits . all of those elements are present here , but the connecting material is exceptionally feeble , to the extent that the patches between action sequences are not just filler , but boring filler . of the four recent u . s . chan releases , operation condor is the weakest , although it still offers a certain degree of episodic entertainment value . the film , which chan co-wrote and directed , plays like a merger of an indiana jones outing and a james bond adventure , and makes far less sense than any entry into either series . operation condor is light on spectacular action sequences and heavy on fights and comedy . there are numerous hand-to-hand combat incidents , all of which are meticulously choreographed ( things still go wrong , as shown in the end-credit outtakes that are a hallmark of chan's films ) . operation condor also features a high humor quotient , with loads of quick gags and longer physical comedy setups , that is enhanced by the cheesy dubbing . from an acting standpoint , chan is the only one worth paying any attention to . as always , he's a leaping , whirling dervish of madcap energy and exuberance . his ability to make any action sequence both funny and exciting is a testament to his talent . other players in operation condor fill their roles effectively , but no one comes close to accomplishing what michelle khan did in supercop -- encroach upon chan's place in the spotlight . give or take a few minor variations , chan films are essentially the same , which is what the fans want . fortunately , chan is so enjoyable that , even though the plots and characters vary from recycled to irrelevant , mediocre films like operation condor still feature bursts of undeniable entertainment . 
what happened to the appreciation of foreign films ? although a few foreign movies such as il postino and like water for chocolate have become popular , most never even get a u . s . distributor . and the vast majority of those that do are promptly ignored . as i sat by myself in an empty theater at the press screening of guantanamera , i lamented the presence of other critics . the local weeklies , the radio station , and , most tragically of all , the local colleges chose to pass on this sweet , subtitled picture . at least the local bastions of learning might be expected to show up , but their newspapers chose not to cover it . everyone seems convinced that hollywood blockbusters and english language , usually american , independents are all that are worth seeing . end of diatribe . and its precious style will engender many a smile if few guffaws . both pictures are light-hearted farces with delightfully uplifting spirits . the colorful clothes of the women and big smiles from some of the inhabitants provide a contrast to the otherwise rampant visual gloom . ( patriotic signs , such as " socialism or die , " periodically dot the roadway . considering the conditions the people live under , the signs prove highly ironic . ) since they haven't seen each other for half a century , the happiness proves too much for her . the rest of the film is a road picture with the corpse and its entourage making its way slowly back to havana . how this could possibly save gasoline is never explained , for obvious reasons . one has only tamarind juice and another just tea and rum . one moment captures the film best . " and there are always solutions . " just bury it . it is in spanish with easy to follow english subtitles . the film is not rated , but it would probably get an r for brief nudity and a little profanity . this sweet little film would be fine kids around 11 and up . although the story far outshines the acting , i do recommend the picture and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
after i'd seen this movie , someone asked me who the good guys were . i had a hard time answering , and that points out one of geronimo's fundamental flaws . for the most part , its characterizations are so weak and ambivalent that the audience finds it difficult to develop much feeling for any of the people we encounter on screen , regardless of whether they're white or native american . this is a beautifully-photographed motion picture , although cinematographer lloyd ahern has a tendency to overuse red and amber filters . if nothing else , geronimo at least has the look of an epic . wes studi , the cherokee actor who gave such an impassioned portrayal of magua in last year's the last of the mohicans , is more subdued as geronimo . gatewood is supposed to be torn by duty to his country and sympathy with a people his government is about to betray , but patric does such a poor job of bringing to the fore anything but surface emotions that we lose all interest in his character and , as a result , the film loses much of its appeal . gene hackman and robert duvall don't give their best performances here , but they're entirely believable , and they elevate the film a level during their scenes . in a more interesting role , duvall is al sieber , an apache hunter who admits to a grudging respect for his arch rival geronimo . although patric's flat performance doesn't help matters , it's the confused and boring script that ultimately proves to be geronimo's undoing . the battle scenes are wonderful , but much of the exposition between them is tedious in the extreme . also , the movie doesn't seem to know which side to sympathize with . instead of that indecision leading to a gritty result , it creates ambivalence and apathy . geronimo is not a bad movie , but neither does it live up to its promise . the legend itself may be fascinating , but this treatment doesn't have the life necessary to be of more than passing interest . those expecting another dances with wolves had better look elsewhere . 
the riveting movie , the hurricane , is based on hurricane carter's true story . directed with loving intensity by norman jewison ( in the heat of the night and a soldier's story ) and starring denzel washington as hurricane carter , in a powerfully moving performance , the riveting movie is likely to earn them both oscar nominations . only in the middle section does the director allow his movie to meander for a bit , but he more than makes up for a slack 15 minutes or so with his rousing last act . cutting back and forth between timeframes , the movie tells hurricane's story . " i tasted my own blood , and i loved it . " jewison convincingly creates carter as a black gandhi . jewison makes the movie as much a detective story as a social commentary and biography . the chances that the current world boxing champion would do this are close to zero . rod steiger , who as the judge du jour seems to appear in every crime drama this year , is finally given the respect he deserves and allowed in this movie to play the part of a judge without parody . the best stories constantly surprise us , which is certainly true of this one . one particularly effective scene has carter , who prides himself on being a " warrior scholar , " talking passionately about the power and magic of writing . since that is my personal joy , i had this strange feeling that he speaking directly to me . like one of those paintings in which the eyes follow only you wherever you walk , this movie speaks to each of us and contains many more messages than you might guess . a picture that can be enjoyed and appreciated on many levels , it is a stunning piece of work that deserves high praise and big box office receipts . it is rated r for language and some violence and would be fine for teenagers . 
it is reported to be a remake of no man of her own ( 1949 ) and j'ai epouse une ombre ( 1982 ) , but since i have never seen either of these i can not verify this . winterboure feels like a movie you have seen a hundred times before , and predictability is its middle name . most of the picture is about whether connie will be found out . what is your guess ? see what i mean , you could write the script yourself . actually , the biggest problem with the show is not its predictability nor its believability , both of which are substantial , but the lack of energy . the actors float through the movie as if they are all on sominex . most of the film is a failed attempt at comedy , but the lines the actors are given are so ineffectual that it is hopeless . frequently the film relies on sight gags that make little sense and are not particularly funny . after trying comedy in the first part , the story switches to a more serious tone toward the end . the characters begin to show their warm hearts , but the characters are so lifeless that this part works no better than the first . i tried to like this show , but there is so little there that it was not possible for me . i will give it this , it is pretty inoffensive . for people wanting to watch something to fall asleep by , it probably fills the bill . it is rated pg-13 for a little bad language . it would probably fine for kids say 10 and up . i do not recommend it , and i give it * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : august 2 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
director : lasse halstrom . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 125 minutes . a word of sympathy , first of all , for the marketing and publicity people at miramax films . i guarantee you i would not want the job of selling to the american public a film in which the character arc of the protagonist is completed by performing an abortion . they'll avoid the subject assiduously , of course , focusing instead on the idea that the cider house rules is about a journey to self-awareness , about learning to make complex choices , and so on , and et cetera , and yada yada , all of which is even ( more or less ) true . it's also true that john irving has no qualms about being provocative , and that he's willing to cast performing abortions in a quasi-heroic light if it serves the purpose of one of his uniquely compassionate tales . the cider house rules isn't worth avoiding simply because of that one thematic element . . . nor , unfortunately , it is particularly worth seeking out . the relationship between larch and homer is the focal point , a strange father-son connection that gives two actors intriguing material to work with . caine is particularly good as larch , playing devilish advocate regarding the harsh realities of the world . irving tries to wink at the mawkishness ( plenty of dickensian references abound ) , but director lasse hallstrom spends a bit too much time lingering on the orphans' upturned faces . for a story that's ultimately not about orphans , the opening of the cider house rules is too much about orphans . to that end , tobey maguire proves to be a marvelous homer wells . his performance is a challenging mix of innocence and experience ; his face captures both a hard life and a life lived in isolation . he's certainly the best choice for an irving protagonist since robin williams' garp , but the cider house rules still can't quite achieve irving-style magic , even with irving himself doing the script honors . the narrative meanders appropriately between homer's relationship with candy , his work with the apple-picking crew and life back at the orphanage , yet the meandering just doesn't have that whimsical sense of purpose that marks irving's novels . it is most worth noting that the cider house rules on film packs 15 years of homer's life into about a year and a half . there may be no better evidence that irving is a writer whose stories really need to be turned into mini-series . the film does do a nice job conveying the theme that " situational morality " need not be an epithet ; indeed , this is may be one of the most deeply radical concepts you'll see on film this year . it is there you see a glimmer of the literary irving , one of the glimmers you can see in maguire and caine . too often , though , those glimmers are obscured by conventional filmmaking . maybe those marketing folk don't have such a tough job after all . in the cider house rules , you have to work a little too hard to find irving the provocateur . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i fell in love with his writings so much that i read every book he ever wrote . only one other serious author , sinclair lewis , would have that same effect on me and cause me to seek out even his obscure early novels . i've also read all of the books of authors like grisham , clancy , etc . , but those are just fun diversions . since i had never seen emilio fernandez's the pearl ( 1945 ) and since " the pearl " was not among my favorite of steinbeck's novels , i looked forward to seeing my reaction to it . there are two quite unusual aspects in the development of the book and the movie . fernandez said that he should make that into a book with a movie in mind , which is just what steinbeck did . although common now , it was rarely done then . steinbeck's motivation was , " i want to keep the film out of the hands of hollywood . " don't get confused . from the beginning , award winning cinematographer gabriel figueroa's black and white photography dominates the picture right along with the heavy music by antonio diaz conde . sometimes it seems the story is only a vehicle for these two talented individuals to show off their wares . the cinematography is highly imaginative . although much lower budget , it reminded me of the innovative work done for citizen kane . figueroa films his characters from below , all the better to enhance their stature into almost mythical figures . conde's music has all the subtlety of a hurricane , but is quite impressive and moving nevertheless . in a beautiful scene , quino dives deep underwater without aid of oxygen . when he stands up in the boat holding it , he looks up to heaven , but then gives a devilish laugh . like an opera or like filmmaker satyajit ray's classic " apu trilogy , " the acting and the gestures are exaggerated , but none the less powerful . the pearl is not realist - it either works as a fable or it doesn't . thankfully , it is a touching fable and is quite successful . so what would be your dream if you discovered great riches ? although some may subconsciously put them down quino's sentiments as trite , it reminded me of my childhood . we were not very well off , and my father , who dropped out of school in the tenth grade , had a single ambition for me - that i would go to college . that i went on to berkeley and got my ph . d . was not as important to him as that enabling first degree . the day i got my b . a . was one of the happiest days of his entire life . the operatic style ending is dramatic and effective . the pearl is a touching movie that speaks to everyone and is well worth renting . it is not rated , but would be g or pg . there is no sex , nudity , or bad language . the film would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested in it . i recommend this small cinematic gem to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : october 26 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
what starts out as a short trip into family entertainment ends up as an interminable , dead-end journey that's likely to have both kids and adults asking the question , " when are we going to get there ? " this is the longest-seeming chase movie since charlie sheen fled the police in 1993's the chase , but it's not nearly as amusing . ninety minutes stuck in a minivan with tom arnold , david paymer , and five annoying kids is not my idea of a fun time at the movies . and , if for some reason you decide to see carpool , it probably won't be yours , either . things might have been okay if this film had gone someplace , anyplace , but it stalls early , then coasts through an hour of minimally- amusing material before screeching to an amazingly improbable stop . the humor is too feeble to overcome the repetitive lethargy of the formulaic storyline . sure , it's fun to see a few cars careening around inside a mall , but do we really need to endure fifteen minutes of such filler ? how he managed to marry a beautiful wife and take enough time off to have two kids are mysteries the script doesn't address . as things develop , it turns out that the kids like franklin , the " nice bad man " , better than daniel , the workaholic good guy . if you're interested in seeing just how far some movies will flaunt logic and believability in order to attain the happiest possible ending , carpool would make a good case study . tom arnold brings a likable , off-the-wall enthusiasm to his role , blunting the more abrasive edges of his usual screen personality to present someone whom children will find appealing . in fact , arnold's performance is the only enjoyable aspect of this production . david paymer is adequate as the stiff-as-a-board daniel -- this is the kind of role he's played more than once . rhea perlman and kim coates , who are supposed to be contemporary keystone cops , are more irritating than funny . a handful of carpool's jokes work , but , basically , this is just the latest in a long line of dumb motion pictures thrown out in an attempt to sucker in families . it's an offensive movie -- not as a result of salacious or violent content , but because it takes for granted a fundamental lack of audience intelligence . neither children nor their parents are quite as stupid as the film makers think they are , and , despite the promise of the accompanying loony toons cartoon , " superior duck " , it's likely that carpool is headed for a deserved box-office wreck . 
steven spielberg's a . i . artificial intelligence is a captivating , science fiction story about the quest for motherly love . a pinocchio-like tale , it features another astonishing , guileless and certainly oscar caliber performance by haley joel osment as a robot ( `mecha' ) named david . divided into 3 sections , the movie is two and one-half parts brilliance and one-half part unnecessary , feel-good ending . reportedly , it is this last part that is uniquely a spielberg touch . kubrick , who wasn't involved after the development stage , is given only a concept credit . these mechanical wonders look exactly like humans unless you penetrate their skins with knives or x-rays . what mechas can't do is have genuine human emotions . the story raises intriguing moral questions at every turn with the greatest of these being : what does it mean to love , what responsibilities do we have as humans and what does it mean to be real ? it also poses such eternal questions of childhood as david's of , `mommy , will you die ? ' a computerized teddy bear ( voiced by jack angel ) , who asserts `i am not a toy , ' is the film's most endearing character , calling to mind spielberg's famous and loveable e . t . david is the film's most tragic character . the intricate script recalls parts of many movies , including sid's toy chest from toy story and the bar scene from the original star wars . stan winston's robotic special effects are amazing , as always . mechas are chopped up , blown up , melted and otherwise slaughtered to delight a cheering crowd . he's a love doll , who does not really love , but can only `make love . ' robin williams -- who else ? -- does a nice turn as the humorous dr . know , a franchised , electronic knowledge dispenser , to whom david turns for advice . john williams's music with its creepy undercurrents reminds us to always be on our guard . filmed in a beautiful haze by janusz kaminski ( shindler's list ) , the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat as you are sweep into its mysteries and its characters . after reaching an absolutely perfect concluding spot , the last act tacks on a long feel good ending that is more likely to infuriate than to please . the result is less than a masterpiece but much , much more than the typical movie fare . and it is , thankfully , a summer movie with something on its mind . a . i . artificial intelligence runs 2 : 20 . it is rated pg-13 for some sexual content and violent images and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . my son jeffrey , age 12 , gave it * * 1/2 . he thought it was interesting and had impressive images . he was troubled by what he thought were many logical holes . he also complained that it ended at the wrong place , saying , `not all fairy tales have to end perfectly in happy endings . ' he , independently , wished that the film would have ended in exactly the same spot that i did . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
he assumes this will happen once he displays the bomb at the science fair and he also thinks , what could they do to me if i'm caught , i'm just a kid ! at the fair , the film breaksdown into a madcap thriller . unfortunately , only a few of marshall brickman's funny pearls get into the script . the one line i liked the best , is when lithgow is warning the kid about how tough the government agents could be when they grill you : " they'll lock you in a room and then they'll throw away the room . " the tense scene back in the science lab consists of all the usual melodramatics seen in most typical action films , but what makes this film a little bit different , is that there have actually been seven fatalities at nuclear plants across america , even though this information is not widely known by the public . i use as my source of reference , for this information , dr . michio kaku , professor of theoretical physics , at ccny . so even if the film sunk rapidly into the pits of a pointless preachy exercise about nuclear dangers , there still was something absorbing about these nuclear scientists seen doing their job . and it was , at least , not one of those awful summer teenager movies . in fact , the acting was quite good in spots , especially , by christopher collet ; he convinced me he was a smart kid , while john lithgow convinced me that he was a scientist with a warm heart . 
cast : martin donovan , john a . mackay , michael finesilver , fritz fox director : eran palatnik producers : eran palatnik , alan abrams screenplay : richard lee purvis cinematography : zach winestine music : robert een not only does the rook's plot become difficult to follow , but the murder mystery lacks twists , red herrings , or surprises . it's too straightforward , and cross' character isn't interesting enough to keep us involved during such a pedestrian investigation . the rook is effectively atmospheric , and there are occasional scenes that function as pointed political commentary , but the main story doesn't work . the film is dull when it should be engrossing , and the material is stretched ridiculously thin to reach feature length . donovan , who typically plays understated roles , virtually vanishes into obscurity -- cross has no personality . had the rook spent more time exploring its unusual setting , the results might have been more satisfying . as it is , however , the strange technological disparities and offbeat social climate become little more than window dressing for the pedestrian plot . even the lamest stories on pbs' mystery offer more genuine suspense than director eran palatnik's sub-par effort . 
when a movie " opens " with an admonition that you can safely ignore the violence against animals since no animals were actually harmed during its production , you know that something is up . amores perros ( love's a bitch ) , an extremely disturbing mexican film that received one of this year's academy award nominations for best foreign film , is a perfect picture for those who think that the violence in movies today is not intense enough . using a format similar to steven soderbergh's traffic , the movie relies on fast pacing and jump cuts to tell three overlapping and intersecting stories . whereas traffic's central theme is drug trafficking , amores perros's common thread is graphic violence against dogs , featuring more cut-up , mutilated and gruesomely dead dogs that you've ever seen or will ever wish to see again . the level of violence is so gratuitous and so disgusting that i picked up my coat several times and started to walk out , something i almost never do . the only thing that kept me in my seat -- other than hoping , incorrectly as it turns out , that the gore would diminish -- was that this is a well made film . highly derivative of other works , the movie by director alejandro gonz ? lez i ? ? rritu and writer guillermo arriaga started me thinking that perhaps their names were pseudonyms and that it was really a steven soderbergh and quentin tarantino collaboration . perhaps the " sport " of training dogs to maul and kill each other will be of interest to some , but i found it repulsive . if you have a pet , if you've ever had a pet or if you're even thinking about getting a pet , this isn't the movie for you . others may enjoy the director's technical proficiency and be able to ignore how derivative his work feels . it's an energetic but sickening thrill ride of a movie . it's also a cinematic low point . what's next ? hacking up babies as a way to provide theatrical thrills to those who have been anesthetized by lower levels of violence ? it is not rated but would be nc-17 for graphic violence against humans and animals as well as for language , nudity and sex . the film would be acceptable for college students and older . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
out of respect for the stunning visuals and family entertainment value of disney's 34th animated feature , i can do no less than recommend the hunchback of notre dame . sadly , however , this is the least- enjoyable animated feature to come from the studio since its 1989 rebirth . the hunchback of notre dame is a notch below last year's pocahontas , which , in turn , was a drop from the previous year's the lion king . still , all things considered , the hunchback of notre dame isn't bad , it's just a little disappointing . despite the over-hyped and overexaggerated " darkness " of the production , kids will love it , so a box office success is assured . and those who carefully review the family entertainment competition this summer will rightfully conclude that hunchback is the surest bet . it's curious that the movie to use the most adult source material has yielded the least potent results . obviously , victor hugo's vision of the hunchback of notre dame couldn't be made into a disney cartoon -- it violates almost every aspect of the studio's traditional , feel- good/happy ending formula . so , predictably , the screenwriters diluted it , but , in doing so , they siphoned off the elements that give the story its unique power . with the darkest and most unpleasant aspects of hugo's tragedy eradicated , there's not much left . the poorly-focused remains are likely to appeal most strongly to the under-12 crowd . unlike past efforts , there aren't many in-jokes and double-entendres to catch the attention of the adults in the audience . the film loosely follows hugo's narrative . in hugo's book , the interaction between these characters fuels a complex and multi- layered drama . for , although we come to feel for " quasi " , neither esmeralda nor phoebus makes a dent in our sympathy . he's not monstrous or ugly ; he's just different . children who consider themselves oddballs or outcasts will likely identify with the hunchback . and the life-lesson about tolerance and respect for others will be understood by nearly everyone who watches the film . according to disney , frollo is the most conflicted and complex villain to have ever been brought to the animated screen . i suppose that's true on one level -- after all , he's tormented by his own lustful impulses , and acts out of religious zeal rather than plain nastiness -- but i doubt many viewers will notice . ultimately , frollo comes across as a bigoted , intolerant , but not overly-frightening , bad guy . the most impressive thing about him is tony jay's deep , resonant voice . from a musical standpoint , the hunchback of notre dame is lifeless . the songs , co-written by composer alan menken and lyricist stephen schwartz , lack energy . there are no show-stopping , toe-tapping numbers . in fact , there's nothing remotely memorable about any aspect of hunchback's soundtrack -- it's easily the poorest effort to come from menken since he started churning out scores for disney ( he's done all of the new wave animated features except the lion king ) . on the other hand , the animation is crisper and more impressive than anything since beauty and the beast , and certain computer-aided sequences are even more eye-popping than beauty's sterling ballroom scene . the festival of fools , where quasimodo first ventures out of the bell tower , is a riot of color and movement , with intricately-animated backgrounds that are more interesting than the foregrounds . if you believe that the primary purpose for animated films is to enthrall children , the hunchback of notre dame is an unquestionable success . if you're looking for entertainment for the whole family , this movie will fit the bill . but if you're anticipating something that's as diverting for adults as for younger viewers , hunchback may disappoint . since the release of the little mermaid , disney has set a high standard for its animated work , and , for the first time , one of the studio's releases struggles to distinguish itself . 
full of marvelously creative and colorful images and energetic music , the movie represents the extended rock video approach to filmmaking . the images are casually and confusingly assembled into a musical montage a la mtv . after this fairy tale is sprinkled on , the story quickly shakes off the pixie dust and moves back into a more traditional storyline . the movie then skips back in time again to examine brian's life . the movie makes much of his bisexuality , with orgies of groupies being common . a complete opposite , curt exudes raw masculinity and likes nothing better than taking off his clothes on stage to shock his fans . curt wears tight-fitting jeans without a shirt , whereas the effeminate brian favors long , flowing gowns and bright , psychedelic colors . the film periodically develops pretentious streaks as it attempts to find meaning in its subjects . the implication is that morals are unimportant if his star can develop sufficient fame . the energetic film is full of good music , even mahler's 6th makes several appearances , but comes to a grinding halt in the last half hour as it decides to get serious . only as a colorful rock video does the film succeed . the dialog and the storyline are merely distractions . even with its limitations as a motion picture , at least velvet goldmine is exceedingly picturesque . it is rated r for strong sexual content , nudity , profanity and drug usage and would be unacceptable for most teenagers . 
an enjoyable b- movie but not quite as good as its reputation suggests it would be . if you can suspend critical judgment regarding the thinness of the story and the robotic acting and taut dialogue that should have been made funnier instead of playing it so straight , then you should be in a receptive mood for what the 1950s took for schlock cyberspace . we are in the prime time of hardened cold war attitudes , which are bristling with military solutions and a case of good old paranoia to keep us on our toes . so what better or easier target for all our pent up anxieties , than for the martians to be the bad guys . now there might be just as many people in this country who believe in flying saucers as there are who don't , so when we see a flying saucer land in someone's backyard and disappear in the ground , the film is on familiar sci-fi turf . in this cheapie production , he makes the most of the sets he created , and in the final battle scenes between the army and the martians , they look good enough to add a certain amount of necessary chills to the film . anyway , life on mars doesn't seem so hot , so why not come to america the land of opportunuty , a haven for those seeking a better life . the only thing serious about this movie , is that it was done in a serious manner . aside from that , it's a harmless tingler with enough thrills in it to make it pleasantly watchable . it is one of those movies where you can find enough in it to think it wasn't so bad ; and , it really wasn't so bad when you come to think about it . the most interesting part of it , is that it gives you a clear view of 1950s attitudes . it reflected a time that was much different from the way things are now : parents spoke to their children in a respectful manner and vice versa , there was a na ? vet ? in its political concerns , and it idealized the small town concepts of america . there are many old-timers who wish america could return to those simpler times . . . even though those times had masked the bigger problems they couldn't face , the problems that blew up in the '60s and changed the language and attitudes of the country . this film was made 46 years ago but seems as if it came from a nostalgic time that will never be with us again . it is worth seeing mainly for those reasons . 
what would you say ? this opportunity of a lifetime may never be yours , but it is john sullivan's ( james caviezel ) in frequency . in a lesser director's hands , this movie could easily have dissolved into schmaltz or a cheap sci-fi flick . director gregory hoblit ( fallen and primal fear ) , aided again by david rosenbloom's perfectly timed editing , delivers a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and a heart-warming father-son story that comes along as a wonderful bonus . the effects of modifying the past are ingeniously explored by the wonderfully complex and satisfying script of first-time writer toby emmerich . the tightly-written script contains twist upon twist , and its potential holes appear to be thoroughly plugged . the intense film works more for the writing and the directing than the acting , although the actors are more than adequate . among the examples of the script's ingenuity is the way that the shared desk is used to communicate across time . this is , however , the type of film that may disappoint some viewers . they liked the action-thriller parts -- including some impressive fires and explosions -- but somehow couldn't deal with sincere expressions of love between a father and a son . personally , i was close to tears . frequency can legitimately be called a good-spirited thriller , a category that barely exists . it is also sometimes funny with one of the best parts concerning a stock recommendation . the intriguing story holds your attention from start to finish . with characters worth caring about and a mesmerizing plot , the movie is thoroughly entertaining and intelligent to boot . and like many a movie , it isn't the saccharinely silly story that the movie's trailers might lead you to believe . this is an intense and fast-paced film that sometimes literally takes your breath away . it is rated pg-13 for intense violence and disturbing images and would not be appropriate for those under 13 . 
these are not pleasant characters , they are sad and funny ; they are pathetic and desperate , but they are definetly not cute or pleasant , and cannot even remotely be thought of as nice people . therefore this romp , down this tawdry road , fits the acting style of james woods to a tee , it seems as if he was born to play these over-the-top , quirky , offbeat roles . and since , it shouldn't be that difficult to figure out , that this film is glued to its brutally violent story line , directed by a director who relishes sleaze , like some have pangs for twinkies , you should have a pretty good idea where this road movie is going to take you ( clark's previous movie was in the same gritty cinema verite style , kids ) . this is the 90s version of that infamous couple's story , just needing a bit more violence and some drugs to tell its tale . the kid very intelligently asks , why me ? what comes next is a learning experience for the young couple , as the kids are treated as if they were full blown junkie grown-ups by their new surrogate parents , treated to champagne and new clothes and lots of dope , but the initial thrill of being a hood begins to change for these druggies , who basically would be content just to make love and sniff some drugs , but are now heavily involved on a trip that is too much for them to really handle . their humor comes in small charges of underlying truths , as they tag along mainly for the ride into big time crime , still too naive to comprehend their total situation . the problem with the film , despite its authentically-acted characterization , is what can you make out of it that makes sense . since the film can't possibly give us much to say about bobbie other than conveying he is the only one of the four characters who might have a chance of surviving and living to be sixty , we can only hope that this kid with the angelic face , can somehow make it on his own . i recently saw james woods on the charlie rose pbs show , where he talked about his love for this film and belief in it , praising its independently directed efforts and sort of castigating the movie industry ( whenever i hear the term " movie industry " , i can only think in terms of business not art ) for not promoting this film and others like it that are honest efforts , refusing to make formula type of commercial films . i can only concur with him , just wishing that an independent film doesn't necessarily have to be youth orientated or about drugs or violence or sex to sell itself . there are so many other themes out there that have not been so thoroughly explored as these themes have been , and therefore for me to really get on the bandwagon of a film such as this , i just want to see something different already . i am inundated up to my tired eyeballs watching films with the same themes , differing only in the nuances and styles of their story , so that their originality comes intermeshed with one another , causing me to sometimes mistake one film for another . and i think , that is the most critical thing that i can say about this often funny , mostly bleak , derivative film , that was credibly but not compellingly acted , in reality , leaving no visual impact on me , it was too much like feeding on junk food and then going home and realizing that you were not eating a healthy meal and , besides , the enjoyment of it wasn't that great to begin with . 
the audience for holy man will undoubtedly be just as nonplussed as g's fictional television viewers since little happens for interminably long periods of time in the movie . the script by tom schulman doesn't know where it wants to take the movie . there isn't nearly enough humor for a comedy , and the attempts at poignancy are awkward at best . schulman's last script , 8 heads in a duffel bag , was awful enough to earn the picture prominent positions on many of last year's lists of the worst films . " it depends on what you call 'flat , ' " he reasons . the movie tries to create a romantic angle between the two of them , but this subplot goes up a dead-end street like the rest of the story . before long he has his own program named -- what else -- " the g spot , " whose tag line is " a higher state of consciousness and non-stop shopping . " his mixture of pop religion and soft-sale capitalism fascinates viewers . would you rather be a " bay watch " babe or the dalai lama ? the movie is peppered with a series of cameos by everyone from football players to old stars in television shopping parodies . eddie murphy , although he is given some raunchy lines totally inappropriate in a pg rated movie , is remarkably restrained . one can have vigor in a role without being obscene , but eddie's brand of humor seems to work best only if it is relatively unhampered . in a movie that is generally as mild as milquetoast , there are nevertheless many parts that parents will find objectionable . the frequent profanity and sexual humor are not appropriate in a pg movie likely to attract kids . and why do we have a joke with the word " penis " mentioned three times in about as many sentences ? since most of the jokes are laced with sexual innuendo , the movie really isn't for kids . on the other hand , there isn't enough humor in the movie for teenagers or adults so the target audience is questionable . sometimes , as in jeff goldblum's long monologue on his father's failure as a salesman , the movie tries hard , too hard , to be touching . never does it succeed as anything other than a comedy , but it is a comedy with remarkably little laughter . although the movie has a long elapsed time of almost two hours , the director spends most of it trying to run out the clock . when the film's corny ending finally arrives , it is as unbelievable as it is predictable . surely , the test screening audiences must have warned them that the movie contained long stretches of humorless and pointless material . why didn't they do massive surgery to trim this celluloid fat ? in its place some truly funny home shopping sequences could have easily been added . it is rated pg for profanity and sexual humor , but parents should treat it as pg-13 . the film is acceptable for kids around 10 and up . my son jeffrey , age 9 , gave the movie * * ? . both boys seemed restless and relatively uninterested during the movie . 
for those who think that foreign-language films must always be pretentious and lugubrious , combination platter provides a pointed counterexample . although this is not an entirely chinese movie ( it takes place in flushing , new york , and approximately forty percent of the dialogue is in english ) , the presence of frequent subtitles will argue otherwise as far as most casual movie-goers are concerned . most movies are designed as methods of escapism , opening windows on lifestyles and stories that , whether momentous or not , are generally unfamiliar to the bulk of the audience . once in a while , however , a film manages to capture the essence of a familiar reality , and its attention to detail can make viewing the commonplace a highly-entertaining experience . combination platter is such a motion picture . helped immeasurably by yoshifumi hosoya's 16 mm camerawork and filmed in a restaurant owned by the director's family , tony chan's motion picture seems almost like a documentary . his dialogue is earthy , his characters have the " feel " of real people , and his comedy is natural ( as opposed to the often-contrived and artificial humor of most films ) . granted , there aren't any scenes in combination platter that will cause audience members to roll in the aisles with laughter , but the movie's sardonic wit will provoke chuckles aplenty . ever wonder what it's like behind-the-scenes at a restaurant ? combination platter gives an uncompromisingly accurate view , broadening its scope beyond the daily grind at the szechuan inn to follow one of the characters , robert , home . his quest to find a wife could be ( and has been ) the premise for romantic comedies , but tony chan handles this situation much differently than a green card . by using a uncommon setting and not dwelling on the potentially-downbeat elements of the situation , mr . chan succeeds at this difficult task . one might wonder what could be so fascinating about spending eighty-odd minutes with the employees of a chinese restaurant ? fortunately , it doesn't take long for the script and actors to answer that question . combination platter is light entertainment , a motion picture " snack " of sorts . and speaking of food , it might be best to see this film on a full stomach , lest you may find yourself leaving the theater for the nearest establishment offering moo goo gai pan . 
this is an authentic " dogma 95 " film , as before the film opens , that assurance comes with a signed guaranteed shown on the screen that it was made according to the rules stipulated by the danish directors who founded this school of sparse filmmaking -- lars von trier and thomas vinterberg . the hand-held camera was obvious throughout the film as were the film's lack of special effects , supposedly giving the viewer a chance to discover on their own any beauty worth finding in the film , rather than to be hit over the head with it . like all dogmas , they eventually wear out whatever usefulness they might have had in the first place . soren kragh-jacobsen's " mifune " is dogma's third approved project , after vinterberg's " celebration " and von trier's " idiots . " it is the weakest of the three , but still , it has some punch in a conventional way due to the film's technical clarity . it is a playfully weird telling of a familiar romantic comedy situation , much like a hollywood formula film . it has a lot of dead spots where it tried comedy and a lot of predictability as far as its romantic situation , but it also had a certain intrinsic beauty about it that kept it afloat and made it seem better than its story was . it is , nevertheless , a surprisingly conventional work , which makes me wonder about all the fuss this dogma 95 group go through to give the impression that they are radical filmmakers . a rather trite choice of subject matter for a group that i would have thought to be more politically motivated . what worked well in this film , was that the actors had personality that flashed on the screen , and that there were some breathtaking nature shots of the golden sun going down and of the rich colors of the danish backwater fields . this film doesn't go against that observation . now i would have bet anyone in the theater and have given them 10-1 odds , that was the last of the marriage , that's how obvious this plot was . her smile is the pure one , while claire also smiles , but her's is a selfish one . this dogma 95 film left me unmoved , though its story was pleasant and well-crafted . it just felt too much like an art-house film designed to please its audience rather than to be provocative . 
this is a well crafted sci-fi film from the 1950s , that became a cult favorite and helped generate interest in the sci-fi film as a popular genre . it had a well-intentioned liberal message in the face of the time's mccarthy witch hunts , it only lacked an edge to its straightforward rational call for world peace and an end to the nuclear arms race . this intelligent and humanitarian film plays like a christian allegory . klaatu even uses the alias mr . carpenter , an obvious reference to christ . lock martin played gort . bernard herrmann's brilliantly haunting musical score aided in capturing the alien atmosphere of the story . it's hard to argue with the rational message delivered , i just wished the film took on the politics of the scientists sleeping in the same bed with the government , who are just as much a detriment to world peace as the xenophobic media and the cowardly bunch of world leaders . 
in this sweet screwball comedy , trixie has never met a sentence that she couldn't fracture . ( " you've got to grab the bull by the tail and look it in the eye . " " i've got an ace up my hole . " ) one of the movie's chief delights is listening for what will come out of her mouth next . all of the cast nicely complement watson , as it is her movie , and watching her is a real treat . from breaking the waves on , she has shown that she is an actress with an amazing breadth who never gives anything less than her all . with trixie we learn that she can be funny as well as dramatic . it is rated r for some language , sexuality and violence and would be fine for most teenagers . 
what saves the lesson from being a reduntant one , is the superb performance of the ensemble cast , all acting in harmony with one another . grant feels like he is just marking time by teaching in such a barren place , that all the kids will just become ditch-diggers anyway , so it is a waste of time teaching them to read . this film adapted from the novel by ernest j . gaines has the mark of truth and morality on its side . it evoked a sense of what rural louisiana was like back in the 1940s for african-americans , and it set the mood for what was to come about in the 1950s and 1960s , as segregation couldn't be justified anymore by a democratic country . what the film lacked was a tension in the story , everything seemed too dry and predictable , except for the theme , which was right on the money . 
while admittedly not a great example of cinematic grandeur , this formula love story/sports movie had a certain charm which managed to lift it slightly above many similar films . once again backed by interscope communications , glaser has fashioned another formula-choked motion picture , only this one doesn't boast moira kelly or d . b . sweeney . the air up there makes it painfully clear how important their chemistry was to the cutting edge , because without it , there's very little worthwhile remaining . anytime there's a movie strictly based on a formula , it has to have a hook to hold the audience . the biggest failing of the air up there is that , moving along for over one-hundred minutes with everyone doing the expected things , it has none . the big basketball game at the end lacks any semblance of tension since , unlike in a real ( or even well-simulated ) sporting event , the outcome is obvious from the beginning . perhaps a romance might have spiced things up , but that probably would have taken away from several tedious male bonding scenes between jimmy and saleh . with the except of the nagging tendency to use slow-motion shots , most of the pseudo-basketball games are well-choreographed . glaser , who used robin cousins as a consultant in the cutting edge , here uses bob mcadoo with similar effective results . while several slam dunks are obviously staged , the scenes on the court look uniformly good . oddly enough , perhaps the most interesting element of the air up there--jimmy's induction into the winabi tribe--is given approximately five minutes of screen time . potentially worth an entire movie in its own right , this sequence is relegated to a few quick clips of kevin bacon climbing a mountain and huddling against some rocks during a thunderstorm . as premises go , the one underlying the major conflict of the air up there is feeble . even in lighthearted movies like this , there are bounds to what a thinking audience will accept , which the air up there flouts . another problematical issue is that saleh doesn't seem like the kind of phenom to engender the kind of interest he gets . in that way , perhaps the casting of 18-year-old charles gitonga maina is a mistake . he's adequate as an actor , but not all that impressive on the court . kevin bacon is at his impish best , but even his bubbly performance can't save a film with this little substance . he manages to invest jimmy dolan with a few human traits , and he does his best with the trite " self-centered guy coming to really care for others " subplot , but there's only so much an actor can do with inferior material . there are good basketball movies out there , hoosiers being the obvious example of a tightly-scripted story with a buildup to a rousing climax . the air up there is appealing and unthreatening , and therein lies its weakness--the unwillingness to take a risk . those who don't mind viewing a recycled story probably will enjoy this film . it has the cool runnings/mighty ducks mentality--a lightweight , brainless family movie chronicling the triumph of the underdog . this time around , he's on thin ice . 
move over , silence of the lambs ! with its rare mixture of intelligent plotting , flawless acting , and start-to-finish tension , copycat is a force to be reckoned with--hopefully both at the box office and when oscars are given out next spring . it amazes me that an entry from this genre , which is normally known for pointless gore and contrived storylines ( see--or rather don't see--don't talk to strangers ) , has turned out a motion picture this keen and complex . it's a difficult task to perfect this sort of story . there are so many areas where the script can fail that it's astounding how seamlessly copycat overcomes all obstacles . there are no stupid characters , contrived resolutions , or deus ex machinas . and the movie doesn't play games with the villain's identity--we aren't left wondering whether he's one of the supposed " good guys . " like seven , copycat isn't concerned with whodunnit , but why they did it and how they will strike next . in contrast to the brad pitt/morgan freeman movie , however , this picture has a rock-solid storyline with no gaping holes in logic . i've never been a big fan of sigourney weaver , but what she accomplishes here is impressive . i can't help wonder how much better death and the maiden would have been had she turned in a similar caliber performance there . from the opening scene in copycat , weaver has a good sense of dr . hudson , and she holds onto the character through all the emotional ups and downs . this is doubtlessly the actresses' best work to date . strong-willed , tough , and extremely competent , her mj monahan is the kind of smart , multi-layered role actors relish , and hunter is on target with her portrayal . this is a contained , dynamic performance without a hint of overacting . in many ways , what the actress does here exceeds what she managed in jane campion's new zealand period drama . the supporting cast is solid . dermot mulroney projects a likable cockiness as monahan's partner . the worst thing that can happen in a movie like this is for the characters to be a step behind the audience . that's not the case in copycat , where the viewer is in synch with what's occurring on-screen . tension and atmosphere are excellent , and director jon amiel pays careful attention to detail . parts of this film are frightening , and will have many viewers either on the edge of their seat or hiding their eyes . and , unlike in many so-called thrillers , the ending is not a let- down . comparisons with silence of the lambs are inevitable , but this movie is no mere copycat of jonathan demme's 1991 feature--it's a well-crafted improvement . 
my wife rented one of her favorite old movies for us to watch again , the 1984 comedy and fantasy called american dreamer . if you like romantic fairy tales and light hearted comedies , then you may find this is the simple sort of fable perfect for a rainy day . i'm going to leave that decision up to you . " her husband is a cliche , but this is a comedy . the show gets really loony at this point , but williams plays the role with great panache and with her good sense of comedic timing pulls it off brilliantly . i love watching williams . makes you want to go live your dreams . conti , who was good during this period of his acting career , is sweet here . the script is lighted hearted and funny , and the director's pacing is zany . the success of the show , however , should be credited to williams . comedy is a personal taste , and for me this show is a fun romp . american dreamer runs about an hour and a half . it is rated pg for reasons of which i am not quite sure . there is no sex , nudity , violence or bad language . it would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested in a comedy featuring adults . i recommend this little picture to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 25 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
short cuts is a dozen short stories all neatly woven together into a seamless whole . most of all , however , it is a robert altman film . let me be candid with you and confess that i have seen most of altman's works , and i generally rank them from so-bad-i-walked-out to watchable-with-some-good-parts . this movie blew me away , perhaps because i love documentaries so much ( e . g . , with the exception of the bad singer who sang terrible , cliched songs , every character was extremely interesting and different . it was a tribute to the script that you could even get to recognize much less care about this many characters in so short a time . i admit it did start a bit slow since it had a lot of people to introduce . the hospital scene with the very sick little boy was so real that i had to keep myself twice from praying for him ! the camerawork and editing was handled especially well - never choppy , yet it switched around a lot among the stories . they used the technique popularized in the movie slacker where the character in story a goes by the character in story b and the camera switches from a to b without changing momentum . also , most of the stories had a character that linked it to another . that the occupations were so varied was another reason it had a documentary feel . like most hollywood movies however they have no idea how many people smoke these days . 80% of the people smoked cigarettes in this movie whereas it is closer to 20% in the real world . also too much smoking of dope in the show as sort of a natural thing to do . one of the lines in the movie was " all they ever do in la is snort coke and shout . " short cuts runs 3 : 07 , but i would not have wanted them to cut it down at all . it is rated r for drug use , nudity , sex , etc . it would be okay for older teenagers if you go with them . i am still thinking about the show , give it * * * 1/2 , and recommend it to you highly . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : february 28 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
a slickly done , very depressive melodrama about those addicted to drugs and their dreams of happiness . it's a film that has excellent performances , especially , the brilliant one by ellen burstyn , as the pill popping old lady who morbidly changes her appearance for the worst after taking diet pills . aronofsky stylishly uses his camera to make us feel the internal grief of those who are looking for an easy way out of their empty lives . it's not an easy film to find comfort in , or feel anything but revulsion at the sight of the constant degradation of human beings taking place . it's also not an easy film to enjoy or to find any insights it has about drug addictions that are fresh . the best scenes in the film were when either harry or sara were reaching out to the other to send out messages of hope . by the film's end , not much substance came through all the stylishly and graphically depressing experiences the four main characters underwent ; what i mostly felt was tired from their actions and not wanting to see any more of their hellish experiences . it's a movie where the first half of it was clearly more subtle and better done than the more morbid and predictable second half . i can applaud the director for his visual style of filmmaking and the actors for giving voice to their characters on the screen in a realistic way , but the story of four losers who can't get out of brooklyn still seems very ordinary despite all the high gloss attached to it . 
screenplay : deborah kaplan and harry elfont . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 96 minutes . deborah kaplan and harry elfont have commented that one of the reasons they made can't hardly wait was that " nobody was making those good john hughes teen comedies any more . " that's probably why can't hardly wait feels so much like a greatest hits compilation , peppered with recognizable elements from the entire hughes oeuvre of the mid-80s and a dozen other teen comedies of the last 25 years for good measure . that's one hefty dose of deja-vu , enough to overwhelm most films this slight . fortunately , kaplan and elfont prove as adept at entertaining as they are at reminiscing . can't hardly wait may be familiar and predictable , but it's never out-and-out dumb , and at times it's surprisingly funny . the appealing cast features solid work from lauren ambrose as vulnerable wiseacre denise and seth green as a tries-too-hard homeboy with whom she ends up locked in a bathroom . some of the forced whimsy does fall flat ( notably jenna elfman's cameo as an " angel " offering advice to the lovelorn preston ) , and kaplan and elfont probably toss a few too many pop culture references on the fire . for once , however , the problems in a teen comedy spring from over-writing rather than under-writing . if there's one noteworthy hole in can't hardly wait , it's the central plot of preston's pursuit of amanda . ethan embry is pleasant enough in an unrequited puppy-dog way , but this is the kind of role john cusack defined a decade ago ; you root for preston not because his entire demeanor sells his longing , but because the machinations of the plot point you in that direction . of all the plot threads running through can't hardly wait , theirs is by far the least interesting , though it's the one inevitably destined to provide the happy ending . still , it's hard not to find charms in a teen comedy that's lively , moderately intelligent and effective in its portrayal of high school social dynamics . it also features a wonderfully eclectic soundtrack which runs the gamut from guns 'n' roses to smashmouth , from third eye blind to run-dmc , from parliament to the title tune by the replacements . can't hardly wait even manages to include a bit of social commentary in its adolescent craziness , promoting environmental awareness , safe sex and responsible drinking and driving behavior . sure , the latter is emphasized when party attendees drop their car keys into a bowl , which is yet another detail swiped from say anything . can't hardly wait shows off its antecedents unabashedly , and still comes up with something satisfying on its own level . looks like john hughes didn't have to worry about telling a generation of movie-goers " don't you forget about me .

director : joe johnston . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 108 minutes . october sky is a tough sort of film to get people to look at clearly . touted in its marketing campaign as " inspirational " and " triumphant " -- usually code words for " sentimental " and " heavy-handed " -- it could easily lead more cynical movie-goers to dismiss it sight unseen as mawkish foolishness . others , of a more feel-good nature , will think they have seen a great film simply because , well , it makes them feel good . it's hard for both potential sets of viewers to get a handle on why october sky works -- it avoids most of the traps the former group fears , while delivering the satisfying emotional resonance the latter group desires . this , of course , is the cue to begin your typical triumph of the spirit , winning-against-the-odds , kids-wiser-than-their parents crowd-pleaser . in some ways , the elements in october sky are quite typical : a determined young hero , societal obstacles , a big climax at a competitive event . yet there are enough ways october sky is _not_ typical to make it surprisingly effective . director joe johnston , best known for special effects-driven films like jumanji and the rocketeer , lends energy and humor to the montage of failed initial attempts at rocket flight . the production creates a complete , convincing picture of its small-town world , treating its characters with a clear-eyed realization that they're neither simple hicks nor salt-of-the-earth country folk . and there's something fundamentally , unconventionally appealing about a film where teenagers are obsessed with an intellectual pursuit , a film where the protagonist proves his innocence of a suspected crime by using a mathematical formula . it is also unconventionally appealing to see a father-son relationship treated with such sensitivity and intelligence . certainly it helps that an actor as subtly gifted as chris cooper is playing john hickam . too many actors would have made him a gruff thick-head who converts to understanding just in time for a big hug ; cooper makes john's stubbornness both caring and slightly dismissive of a boy acting smarter than his own pa . jake gyllenhaal is equally enjoyable as homer , making his fascination with rocket science an expression of his desire to explore the universe beyond coalwood . the interactions between john and homer form october sky's emotional backbone , and nearly every one of them is pitched at a level of conflict which seems honest rather than movie-conflict shrill . there are a number of occasions when october sky does begin to feel like its more convention-bound cousins . there is an obligatory romantic sub-plot for homer which appears and disappears so quickly that there hardly seems to be a point ; an illness experienced by homer's favorite teacher ( laura dern ) , while historically accurate , further bogs down the narrative . the last half-hour of october sky is not nearly as well-paced as the first hour , dragging out homer's journey to the national science fair , but that doesn't detract from the film's many pleasures . october sky is inspirational , and it is triumphant ; it's also smart , well-written , and well-acted . this one shows that feel-good movies don't also have to be feel-dumb movies . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : kevin wade and chris conrad . director : ivan reitman . in 1988 , arnold schwarzenegger , danny devito and ivan reitman set the standard for " high concept " with their comic vehicle twins . in hollywood pitch-meeting parlance , it could be reduced to five words-- " schwarzenegger and devito are twins " --and proved that sometimes a simple idea and the right talent could add up to $100 million even with a paper-thin script . and in a limited sense , it works . junior is so simple and gently directed that the warm performances of emma thompson and schwarzenegger manage to struggle through a script that always goes for the easy gag , and even then can't make most of them particularly funny . the impregnation is a success , but of course complications ensue . this is not hollywood's first attempt at a pregnant man story , and the disastrous first attempt ( the joan rivers-directed billy crystal vehicle rabbit test ) would not seem to inspire eagerness to give the premise another try . the joke in junior , of course , isn't just that a man is pregnant ; it's that the man in question is arnold schwarzenegger . schwarzenegger's choices of roles in the last several years have demonstrated a mastery of his own image , as he alternates action blockbusters with against-type comedies , and he has proved remarkably adept at both . as limited as his acting skills may be , he is usually very likable , and junior is no exception . those familiar with thompson only from her branagh/shakespeare and merchant/ivory efforts will be quite pleasantly surprised by her goofy performance in junior . her dianna , a clumsy and socially inept scientist , is the perfect match for schwarzenegger's hesse , and thompson's delightful moments of physical comedy make her scenes with arnold very appealing . that's really what junior has going for it : appealing performers at their most appealing . most of the jokes are based on the obvious incongruities of schwarzenegger in the family way--his appearance in a prosthetic belly ; his emotional response to a sappy kodak commercial ; his delivery of lines like , " my nipples are very sensitive . " and it's only because schwarzenegger seems to be having so much fun that any of it works . other bits , including the obligatory scene of a baby with urine streaming down its leg , are too trite for any amount of good will to make them work . the script , credited to kevin wade and chris conrad , is full of missed opportunities and silliness instead of any real inventiveness . frank langella , who was so good in the reitman-directed dave last year , is woefully underused as the obligatory villain , and gets the most obvious comeuppance available . perhaps that's the word that defines junior best : obvious . this is terrain we've all seen many , many times before . but the cast of junior is so engaging that it feels like we're seeing that terrain in a very comfortable car , in the company of old friends . 
bed of roses is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie , at least the first two thirds of the movie is , which is the movie's major , but not quite fatal flaw . it is not that the last third of the movie is bad , it just does not exist at all ! it is a movie that promises much more than it delivers , and yet it is a touching and romantic fable that lifts your heart before it makes a fast exit for reasons that baffle me . i am glad i saw it , but i wish i could have gotten to know the two lead characters much more . i really care about these two sweet souls . playing a character similar to the wonderful one he played in the much better movie untamed heart , christian slater is lewis farrell . in the straightforward but poetic script by writer and director michael goldenberg , lisa quickly finds out that , you guessed it , lewis sent the flowers . shaken , lisa tells kim that night that " i don't have room in my life for somebody this great . i work for a living . " just when you get thoroughly hooked on this movie , it takes a sharp turn left followed a couple of minute later by a sharp right and then a few minutes later it abruptly ends . i could not figure out if the writer ran out of ideas or what . perhaps test screening audiences did not like the last part so the editor ( jane kurson ) just cut it entirely . for whatever reason , the producers ( michael haley , allan mindel , and denise shaw ) should have demanded the script be finished properly before they released the film . this is an enthralling film transformed into a mediocre one because of this truncation . i suspect the cause is the editing because there were other parts , like her abused childhood , that are hinted at somewhat obliquely and where you are keep waiting for more explanations or flashbacks that never materialize . i think they exist on some cutting room floor . the movie feels more like a great work in progress than a completed film . perhaps not on the level of mahler's tenth , but at least something special that i wish had been fully developed . the acting by masterson and slater is marvelous . she delivers a compelling and complex performance . slater gives a genuinely tender and touching one . in one of many good scenes he takes her to listen to children's stories at the library not because he has kids but because the storyteller is so good . pamela segall takes the minor role as the friend and makes it special . i liked the makeup where they had kim look much prettier than lisa making the audience wonder whether lewis would fall for kim at some point in the show , and if so when . it is rated pg for a couple of bad words . this romance would not offend anyone of any age . there is no sex , nudity , or violence of any kind . there are a few quite effective but simple kisses . nevertheless , this is one very romantic movie . okay , two thirds of a romantic movie . the movie is strong enough that even though they amputated it , i still recommend it , but i am unable to give it more than * * 1/2 because of this travesty . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : february 2 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
that is how the film got its title of " the chase . " it was a fascinating scene , darkly capturing the tortured mind of chuck and the stifling atmosphere of cuba during the mid-forties . this film noir is memorable for its dark , dream-like feel , as reality becomes indistinguishable from the dream sequences . because of those shots , this film became a cult classic ; but , it is one that is rarely shown on tv . they specialize in dark and expressionistic works , which this film is perfect example of . 
if you like documentaries ( i love them ) or if you are interested in the making of films especially the cinematography and the editing , i have an excellent film to recommend called the wonderful , horrible life of leni riefenstahl . it is making short stops throughout the country . i have also seen this movie referred to as the power of the image : leni riefenstahl . leni riefenstahl , now aged 90 , but looks much younger , was blessed with being one of the most gifted filmmakers ever . her 1935 nazi documentary , called triumph of the will , has been labeled in retrospect as the most important propaganda film ever made . in response she keeps getting upset and saying she was not pro-nazi but just pro-german and that she didn't really realize everything that was going on , etc . heavy denial . you can watch this part for yourself and see what you believe . the most interesting part of the film , has riefenstahl talking about making films , about camera work , and about editing . these were physically challenging films where , without any stunt people , she had to climb sheer mountain peaks - often barefoot and with no ropes . sometimes the scenes required her to be tied up and have simulated or real avalanches fall on her . she went from acting to directing during this period although she stared in some of her movies , e . g . , the blue light , as well . they also tried stuff that proved useless like sending up a balloon with a small camera attached . she then spent 2 years of long hours doing nothing but editing the film . even after the war , olympiad was voted one of the 10 best films of all time by the americans . given her zeal for perfection she never made any of this footage into a movie . seeing this 90 year old swimming around making movies is amazing . the wonderful , horrible life of leni riefenstahl is a excellent film , but it needed riefenstahl to edit it more ! at 2 : 15 it would have been much better . the underwater part that takes up the last half hour or so should have been cut to 5 . the interrogation about why didn't she emigrate in the 30s was too repetitious and should have been cut in half . you could really experience her energy and her drive for cinematic perfection . i give the movie * * * 1/2 and strongly recommend it to all cinema buffs . it is unrated , but would probably rated pg . kids over 8 interested in movie making or in history would be fine seeing it . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : may 24 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
it is one of those extra long ( 230 minutes ) and slowly paced films , that is a chore to stay tuned into . one deserves to get a c in audience 101 , for just remaining awake while watching it . it doesn't help that the characters are not appealing and do not draw us into their story . the thing here is history as mixed in with the loose telling of aeschylus' oresteia tragedies-- characters are even named orestes , electra , and chrysothemis . we see them in towns that appear to be shabby and depressing , as the years keep changing , as does the political climate . things certainly look glum ; the only cheer comes from the actors , as they are transported through the far-out regions of greece and sing their rhythmic songs of freedom , love , and sadness with a dignity and verve that enraptures the film in a very moving mood . you can feel the pulse of the times through the music and realize that big events are happening to the people of greece . the film assumes a lot for a foreign audience viewing it , that they would be knowledgable about greek political happenings and of the greek tragedies and of its history . the modern greek history of betrayal , revenge , and redemption are both the subtle and underlying themes of the story , as seen through the eyes of the weary acting troupe . in the most moving scene of the film , the actors bury him and start applauding him for the life he lived as he is buried ; it is as if they were saying , what a performance you gave in life . most of the film was unfortunately not as stimulating and was too trying a task to follow in all its different kind of historical rejoinders , even though this is a worthy film , visually bringing real life into focus , in a way that is unique and psychologically absorbing . there is no doubt about it , this is a theo angelopoulos film , not relying on cohesiveness of plot or dialogue to tell its story for the record of history . his camera moves around for many different and enticing angle shots but his takes go on forever , touching every little gesture and staying with them for minutes at a time without any action taking place , making the film a very difficult watch for most non-greeks . the neutrals just tried to please those in charge at the time . theo angelopoulos is a great filmmaker , but this first feature of his to achieve international recognition is not a great film as much as it is a vital telling about political intrigue . it is a film that is relevant ; a good peek at modern greece and how it is politically divided . my hat is off to anyone who can say they were enthralled with this entire film , not the pieces of it here and there like i was . 
a stylish piece of film noir , it has exasperatingly slow pacing but devilishly demented characters and a wonderfully wicked , labyrinthine plot . characters die , or do they ? the coen brothers make interesting movies . most people know their most famous picture , the oscar winning fargo , but even the brother's failures ( the hudsucker proxy for example ) contain large flashes of brilliance . they claim to have taken out some of the boring parts and added in a bit as well . but the running time is about the same and the movie seems little changed with the exception of a hilarious introduction . the print is clean and the sound sharp . as the movie opens , a supercilious film preservation expert in his library pauses in his reading and pipe smoking to provide us a little history about the film . he explains that the movie was a tremendous success and started the entire indie craze . after this delicious bit of satire , the director's cut segues nicely into the original story . " not really , " meurice replies . the intriguing script is much better than the directing , and one is left with a strong wish that the coen brothers had done a much more meticulous job of excising the boring parts in this director's cut . still , it is a fascinating little tale and amply demonstrates the talent of these filmmakers . ( for a little extra fun , listen carefully and see if you can recognize the female voice on marty's answering machine . it's an uncredited role , and the actress does not appear in the movie . ) blood simple runs a remarkably slow 1 : 37 . it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for most teenagers . ( there is only a single scene that will have viewers squirming . ) 
apparently , the judicial system has broken down , so much so that it can't satisfy the political electorate who want stiffer punishment and those who want more of an emphasis on education and counseling programs for the nonviolent offenders . the prison atmosphere of hostility , constant danger , noise , and inhumanity , was fully captured , as the film had the gritty , realistic look of a prison . the convicts looked scary , the prison looked real , and the feeling of despair was the only air that was present , as rehabilitation seemed to be a farce , a show that one puts on to score clemency points from the judges . the acting was just fine . i don't know if anyone seriously believes anymore that the prisons can be a place of rehabilitation . the film does a very good job in bringing this out and creating an entertaining picture because of the fine performances . but it also seemed to stage everything in the story to weigh heavily into what its message was . the film didn't feel like it was freely flowing along , and because of that the story floundered at times . 
with the material for a great parody , the movie's worst sin is that the actors , who shamelessly overact , take it all quite seriously . a marketing phenomenon , the picture was released to just 300 screens but rocketed to capture a spot on the top 10 box office list the week that it came out , thanks to local churches talking it up . the religious thriller , produced by the trinity broadcasting network , can truly be called a thriller of apocalyptic proportions . avoiding any sex , nudity and even a single " darn , " the film , except for its gun violence , was carefully crafted in an attempt to appeal to a family audience . as a clue to his true identity perhaps i should mention that strange bombings , food shortages and epidemics have recently been striking the planet . their program has the 3d text dancing on the screen like a double-helix ballet . only as an old-fashioned b-movie , the type that got second billing on a kids' saturday afternoon double feature , does the omega code have any appeal . the delight of those movie was that everyone could hoot at them , and some of the kids would even throw popcorn boxes at the screen , as we all roared at how ridiculous the picture was . it is rated pg-13 for violence . the film would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up , but most kids of any age are going to be bored stiff and confused by the movie . 
although some films , most notably trainspotting , have had some success in transforming heroin addicts into comedic subjects , addicts aren't exactly high on the list of people normally considered hilarious . jesus' son , based on a series of denis johnson short stories and adapted for the screen by no less than three screenwriters , never comes together into a cohesive or compelling story . although some scenes , such as the one about a guy with a hunting knife through his eye , possess a devilish black humor , most fall flat . dennis hopper's cameo turns unintentionally hilarious . shaving cream keeps appearing and disappearing on his face in one of the more humorous continuity errors in some time . most of the movie will leave you asking yourself , " what was that all about ? " one can make some guesses as to what it means , but the overwhelming feeling is that you don't care since fh is such a distant and unappealing character . it is rated r for graphic drug use , strong language , sexuality and some violent images and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older . 
stage fright is a hardly frightening but , nonetheless , laudable movie , that features hitchcock's droll humor and his perfection in regards to set arrangements . this is a mystery tale that is not too difficult to figure out who the guilty party is , but the fun comes in playing along with the man on the run theme and to follow along with his love stricken wannabe actress maiden heroine and her eccentric family , and take-in the mae west-like performance from the incomparable marlene dietrich , as charlotte inwood , a stage actress/chanteuse with a rather vulgar personality and an odd sense of humor , who rules the london stage world as if she were a pampered peacock with fangs . this film is more of a romantic comedy than a suspense film , though there is an element of grave danger that comes about in the final scene for the heroine . she is acceptable in this damsel-in-distress role , but doesn't really sparkle in the role and make you feel for her , perhaps , like a grace kelly would have . this film , the second one hitchcock has done in england since his return there from america , is one of the master's most subtle and sharpest comic efforts . stage fright is sandwiched in between hitcock's " under capricorn " and " strangers on a train " , and is equal to if not better than both . this is certainly not hitchcock's best work , it is not suspenseful enough for that , after all , the master of suspense should live up to his reputation . but , the film is very diverting and artfully done , and dietrich was never better . watching her performance alone , was enough for me to love this hitchcock work , even though it is merely a minor one in his opus . 
it was hard to believe how bad this sophomoric spoof on catholicism is , but seeing is believing . kevin smith ( clerks/mallrats/chasing amy ) has shown what it takes to make a satire that isn't funny and one that doesn't have enough bite in it to be subversive ( it is not shocking to know that the director is a practising catholic ) . this one is a yawner , one in which i found it difficult to sit through , as its two hours of belabored effort and uninspired acting seemed longer than that ; and , it was all in the name of getting beat over the head with the director's inane indulgent musings on religion , as he tries to gross the audience out with foul language , sight gags of unpleasant sights , such as a pile of shit emerging from a toilet bowl , and an irrelevant premise for an argument against catholicism , an argument that is about as crude a one as i have heard in some time . it is also a film that left me disgusted not only because of its banal argument against catholicism , but because it was a wise-guy film , shot with a sneer , by someone without the temperament and intellectual stability to make such a metaphysical film . the filmmaker is way over his head in this attempt to combine serious argument with one of silliness , spending most of his time lecturing and moralizing the audience with his half-baked knowledge of theology and then resorting to shock techniques to get across his laborious point of view , as if it is a startling revelation he was revealing , that there is politics in the catholic church . the film's original distributor , miramax , ran into trouble with the catholic league who complained about the film's sacrilegious content and therefore forced it to be distributed by a smaller studio , lion's gate . the protestors were right about one thing , the film is offensive . but they are wasting their time protesting , this movie shouldn't be banned ( i don't want to see films banned ) . this film's only crime is that it is a revolting film and there is no reason to make it a martyr , we have enough martyrs in the world already . take my word for it , seeing god in this film is anticlimactic . that carlin , a natural comedian , is not funny in this role , a role that is ready-made for comedy , indicates how poorly things are going for smith . the premise of " dogma , " is that glick's church re-dedication will allow the banished angels to re-enter heaven , thus proving god fallible and , thereby , negating all existence . fiorentino and rickman are flat and unconvincing in their roles , getting neither comedy nor drama out of their performance , just giving me a mild headache listening to them deliver their vacuous lines . catholic dogma declares god's word to be unquestioned and to be a good catholic one has to accept the dogma without questioning it . the problem with these revelations , is that they are not exactly fresh news and they seemed to be delivered in such a jarring manner , as if the actors were puppets just mouthing words that seemed out of place . there was just no flow in this film , just long periods of schlock comedy and boredom and endless talking . to take this film seriously is a big mistake , which is why i have no sympathy for protestors of this film . if you got some laughs out of this mishmash , then you got more than i did from it . i just felt relieved that i sat through it and didn't walk out . smith appears to be a very limited director , he can't shoot action scenes , and his film was childish and unfocused . it was one of the most disappointing films i have seen , so far , in 1999 , especially noting how it got some favorable comments when shown in film festivals in america and abroad . what is particularly disturbing for me , is that his religious message isn't wrong -faith should not be a burden but a blessing , and his view on the corporate heads who finance films , who worship only money , is not something that i entirely disagree with , i just don't see him as the one delivering this message . 
it has to be a record . even with 7 writers ( alison fouse , greg grabianski , dave polsky , michael anthony snowden , craig wayans , marlon wayans and shawn wayans ) , scary movie 2 still couldn't come up with a single good scene . another record might go for the biggest drop in quality from the original movie to the sequel . scary movie was imaginative and funny , but its sequel is neither . long stretches of boredom are interrupted periodically by whispered groans of " yuck ! " although outrageous physical comedy can be hilarious , as there's something about mary proved , the mere presence of gross-out gags does not guarantee that something will be funny . let me take you on a tour of some of the humor misfires in scary movie 2 . in the restaging of the bedroom barfing scene from the exorcist , they appeared to have used the same special effects team that created the massive waves in the perfect storm , as huge wave after wave of vomit hits everyone in the room . the verbal jokes aren't much better than the physical comedy . " kiss my grits , " is one of the insults that , one guesses , is supposed to be funny . never has a movie franchise fallen so far so fast . scary movie 2 runs long even at a mere 1 : 20 . it is rated r for strong sexual and gross humor , graphic language and some drug content and would be acceptable for older teenagers . my son jeffrey , age 12 , gave the movie just one * . he said that it was sometimes funny and sometimes disgusting . the foul-mouthed parrot appeared to have generated the majority of his laughs . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
you especially want to praise popular movies , and most of all you want to save your highest rating for cult pictures with strong and vociferous followings . nothing like grade inflation and ignoring your instincts for making your own life more bearable . i consistently ignore this rule . i am generally in the mainstream of reviewers , but when i can not stomach a show as i couldn't in trainspotting i say so knowing full well i will get complaints . less than full honesty isn't fair to my readers . its coming to america has been perhaps the cinematic art house event of the year . for my money , shallow grave , flaws and all , is a much better film than trainspotting . mainly trainspotting focuses on the camaraderie of the druggies and of their humor . the ongoing joke has them trying just hard enough to get a job so they don't get kicked off the dole , but being sure that they are so repulsive that no one will actually hire them . the dialog by john hodge and based on irvine walsh's novel has many funny lines . if the images were not so horrible , perhaps i could have enjoyed them . choose your future . but why would anyone want to do a thing like that ? " most of the humor is visual with a subtext of isn't addition fun and funny at the same time . this makes for a hard to watch film , which isn't necessarily bad . i enjoyed harold and maude about suicide and a lot of other films with shocking subjects , but in trainspotting the filmmakers are so far over the line , that i could not like the picture no matter how hard i tried . i kept thinking to myself , what is next ? are we going to have a comedy full of realist images about how much fun it was to gas people in world war ii ? let me give you two typical scenes and then i will be done with this review . the lingering camera makes sure you see in detail the feces dripping down each of their faces . never in your worst nightmare have you seen such a filthy place . trainspotting runs 1 : 33 . it is rated r , but why it is not nc-17 is beyond me . in addition to the frequent heroin usage scenes , there is violence , constant foul language , sex , and full male and female frontal nudity . since the mpaa gave this film an r , they might as well just retire the nc-17 rating . i strongly recommend that teenagers not see this film at all . for adults , i will grant you that the show is imaginative and the dialog sharp , but i can not recommend this painful show to anyone . for a show i truly hated , i still will give it * 1/2 for the high energy and the clever albeit unbearable script . as it is , i feel like i am being ridiculously generous to the film . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
even today , it remains a popular video rental in this country . the press kit likens its restoration work to that for the hugely popular star wars special edition series . rather than add visuals to existing scenes as lucas did , petersen includes much more already existing footage . the original release of das boot ran 2 : 29 . the director's cut adds a full hour , and the rumor is that the director originally wanted to add two hours . what is similar to the star wars restoration is the treatment of the sound . petersen and company completely redesigned and re-recorded new sound effects . the result is impressive . the original sound received one of the film's five oscar nominations so the foundation for the digital remastering is substantial . there is no question that the changed sound improves the picture . toward the end of the review , i'll compare the original with the remake in terms of the material added . in many films the director does not play a dominant role ; liar liar was one recent example . in others , such as last year's secrets & lies , the director takes total control and molds the film into his vision . he went on to hollywood where he came up with several thrillers -- the best being in the line of fire with clint eastwood , john malkovich , and rene russo . the trailers look quite promising . prochnow gives a brilliant performance as the stoic captain who takes a cynical view of the war and his role in it . " like i'm on a children's crusade . " even with a large cast , the director manages to make the characters distinguishable and engaging . the simple but chillingly realistic script succeeds not through its memorable lines , of which there are precious few , but because of the situations it creates . the ensemble cast does the rest . remember , a submarine is like library . there is no talking allowed when it is open for business . instead of dialog we have some of the most complex and emotive facial expressions in any film . petersen says his vision for the film was , " to show the gritty and terrible reality of war and to combine it with a highly entertaining story and fast-paced action style that would pull audiences into the experience of these young men . " no matter whose side you were on in ww ii , these actors earn your empathy . moreover , petersen's engrossing storytelling abilities will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire picture . during the battle scenes i found my mouth kept hanging open as i wondered if this was going to be the depth charge that would blow them to smithereens . in 1982 das boot was the most expensive german film ever made up to that time . the result aimed for realism , not flash . the chief criticism of the picture stems from its main attribute : it is , arguably , the most claustrophobic film ever constructed . and yet , many small scenes , such as the one of the crew singing their favorite song , " it's a long way to tipperary , " illustrates the crew's humanity . although certainly a technical tour de force , the film occupies a much more important place in cinematic history . it shows up on many best films of all times lists , and other directors like steven spielberg cite its influence on their work . in one of the best anti-war films ever , there is no preaching against war . the film makes its powerful statement without needing to proclaim its message . when the movie was originally released i saw it first with subtitles and then in a dubbed version . although the dubbing was well done , the subtitled version is much better . and , i am thankful to report , the director's cut is subtitled . one of the beauties of it having been fifteen years since i saw the movie is that i had forgotten most of the details and remembered only the impressions it made on me . i will not reveal the ending in the hopes that you either have forgotten it or have never seen it . i found the ending surprising , but perfect . i promised to tell you which version i preferred -- the original or the director's cut . first , let me say that i cannot imagine your not wanting to see this director's cut if you have any serious interest in film . it is an expansive vision of a seminal picture that demands to be seen . i loved the director's cut and give it my highest rating . all of this notwithstanding , the original version with its tighter focus is the better of the two . the restoration , however , does have the improved soundtrack , and the original can no longer be seen in theaters . although das boot is a picture that can work on a small screen , its impact can only be fully felt in a theater . see it before it moves to video . i suspect its theatrical run will be brief so act now or you may never again have the chance . it is rated r for war violence , rear male nudity and some profanity . it would be fine for teenagers . i give the film my strongest recommendation and top rating of * * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
costa-gavras ( z/missing ) presents a film about the media exploiting the news and expects us to be surprised to find out that all they care about is the ratings . the big carnival did this theme better , as long ago as 1951 . the film is one-dimensional in scope , no one has room to grow . the amusing relationship between travolta and dustin captures our attention for most of the film , but nothing interesting happens . the world of the media is shown to be worse than ever , as this new breed of executives are not really news people . the actors tried too hard to make something out of nothing . in the end , it is an old news story that we got-- but this time it is manipulated by the movie director instead of the anchor man and the new corporate executives . 
john ford's epic western about america and its racial past , is the quintessential american film about what it once meant to be american , more than any other film that i could think of , and that includes citizen kane . it is ford's best , one that is much more than the western it appears to be ; it is a film that is eventually about self-discovery , seen symbolically through the eyes of one man , john wayne . there is not one single actor in the world who could have played this part better than wayne . in the opening scene , he is only there briefly and does not feel very comfortable in that short stay , even when idolized by the children . ethan does not belong to either the white settlers or the indians . that he hates indians so much , yet speaks their language and feels comfortable with their ways , more so than he does with white society , makes it difficult to figure why he has so much hatred for them . his story is visceral poetry , a tragedy that turns ridiculous , as ford wanted it to be , and it has unexpected psychological twists to it that can be read into the story by one's own relationship with america . it is hard not to substitute his hatred for indians into a hatred for blacks , and it is easy to see how wayne's soul could be construed as america's soul . make no mistake about it , this is not an ordinary or very good western , this is undoubtedly a masterpiece of american cinema , one that many of the early 1950s film critics couldn't see . it is not that it is a particularly profound movie , but it is one that caught the emotions and the metaphors of a rich country with a paradoxical past and an intangible future . over-the-years , the status of this film has grown immeasurably , to the point that its anti-hero hero is now a fixture on the cinematic scene , along with the recognition that ford has created a work that searches deeply into a man's interior and into the country's consciousness . if there was a more perceptive western made , one that captured the visions of america better , i have not seen such a film . if there is such a film out there , i will take the liberty of using wayne's favorite retort in the film : " that'll be the day . " 
the commercials for in the mouth of madness remind us that john carpenter is the man behind arguably the best modern horror film , halloween . however , despite what the marketeers might wish us to believe , the pictures have little in common except for a few well-orchestrated scares . halloween was creepy , atmospheric , cunningly scripted , and frightening . in the mouth of madness is confusing , weird , and not very involving . it's easy to sit back and impassively be impressed by some of what in the mouth of madness attempts to do . without gratuitous sex or gore , the film works to create an intelligent horror experience that mixes nightmares , reality , and fantasy . this is a tactic employed by the far better wes craven's last nightmare , and here it feels a bit like a retread . also , in pursuit of all his nifty ideas and mind-bending twists , writer michael de luca forgot to fashion believable characters . despite a magnificently-entertaining performance by sam neill , his john trent never really connects on any level with the audience . in trying to be inventive and unique , the story occasionally manages instead to annoy and confuse . there's too much of the dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream and other similar stuff going on . a little of this might have created a nice sense of ambiguity , but carpenter overdoes it . as a result , his story gets buried too deeply beneath the overriding question of whether trent is real and insane or a fictional character who's the only one aware of what's going on . at this point , we're reminded of sleepy castle rock in needful things . admittedly , an intellectual horror story is infinitely preferable to a gory slasher flick , but in the mouth of madness falls a step short of being a worthy entry . the final , missing ingredient--whether it's a hero we can really root for , a more engaging script , or a better actress as linda--leaves carpenter's latest firmly grounded in mediocrity . and , looking back to halloween , we know he's capable of rising far above that . maybe his next film , a remake of village of the damned , will remind us of the kind of great horror the director can give us . 
it is considered by many to be a classic movie and is the first part of director satyajit ray's " apu trilogy . " the movie has a lot going for it , not the least of which is extremely earnest and heartfelt performances by all of the cast . in its depiction of abject poverty it reminded me somewhat of king vidor's our daily bread ( 1934 ) and john ford's the grapes of wrath ( 1940 ) . i am sorry to report that , being one of the slowest films i have ever seen , i did not like pather panchali . sincerity is not enough for me ; i like a movie where something happens . at first i had trouble figuring out what was going on since not much of anything was happening so i figured i was missing something . after a while it dawned on me that pather panchali is a slice of life movie , but one at a glacial pace . the director gets lots of long sequences of people looking pensively . the movie works best in the scenes of everyday life . most of the movie consists of incidents like durga stealing fruit from the old family orchard that used to belong to them . pather panchali may be an acquired taste . certainly the acting is straight forward and earnest , but not much actually happens in the film and what does happen happens so slowly . i think tighter editing ( dulal dutta ) and a more energetic script ( bibhutibhushan bandyopadhyay and satyajit ray ) would have kept my attention better . finally , for me the best part of the picture is the music by ravi shankar who was then an unknown musician . it is sublime . pather panchali runs 1 : 55 , but i think it would have been much more effective at about 1 : 25 . the picture is filmed in black and white and the print i saw was in acceptable shape , but showed its age . the film is in bengali with english subtitles . it is not rated , but would certainly be rated g . there is exactly one mildly harsh word in it , and there is no sex , nudity , or violence . the movie would be fine for children of any age , but the slowness would lose most of the young ones . i admire the sincerity of the film , but i can not recommend it no matter how much of a classic it is . it is unmercifully slow . for its sweetness i give * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
these simple episodes are all admirable but rarely engaging . and , although the movie comes in at a mere 78 minutes , 10 would have sufficed . after about 3 minutes , each of the stories has made its rather straightforward point quite gracefully . the next 20 minutes of each adds little other than needless reinforcement . the mullah , in the story's only memorable line , calls her bicycle , " the devil's mount . " toloui's acting is exquisite , showing her pain and determination with eye expressions alone . it's always hard understanding someone else's religion , but the images shown of islam in this picture give one a feeling of sad repression . and it is the images alone that stay with you after this film is over . the film is in farsi with english subtitles . it is not rated but would probably be a g since there isn't anything offensive . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
" executions 'r us " could read the business card of fred a . leuchter jr . , the engrossing subject of errol morris's latest documentary , mr . his camerawork choices are both beautiful and insightful . and he manages to find humor without ever resorting to cheap shots and to make the potentially repugnant absolutely riveting . in a film with two distinct but seamless parts , morris presents us with the life of engineer leuchter . through this he developed an interest in prisons , specifically executions . " i was very concerned about the humanitarian aspects of death by torture , " leuchter explains . before leuchter came along , electric chairs were generally built by inmates or electricians , not based on any blueprint or design but on seeing a picture of some other state's old electric chair . this led to some pretty horrific executions when the chair did not serve its intended purpose of putting a person to death as quickly and as painlessly as possible . " i am a proponent of capital punishment , " leuchter tell us . " i am not a proponent of capital torture . " the movie is at it's most convincing when it easily disproves leuchter's disproof of the annihilation of the jews . his descent proves more rapid than his ascent . morris's gripping film tells a fascinating story of a little man who let his accomplishments inflate his ego until it burst . it is rated pg-13 for mature themes and would be fine for teenagers . 
screenplay : ed decter & john j . strauss and peter farrelly & bobby farrelly . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult humor , sexual situations , brief nudity ) running time : 115 minutes . i'll worry tomorrow about whether i've consigned myself to film critic hell ; today , i'm still waiting for my cheeks and sides to recover . i'll worry tomorrow about whether or not the farrelly brothers portend the end of civilization as we know it ; today , i'm still grateful someone is willing to push the comedic envelope into heretofore unknown zip codes . tomorrow i many not believe i've sent the following words to an unsuspecting world : today , i believe there's something about mary is the funniest comedy i've seen in this decade . it may also be the most consistently , unapologetically tasteless comedy i've seen this decade . never mind . the plot is really beside the point . there's something about mary is really a collection of comedy-of-errors set pieces which find gags in the mentally handicapped , the physically handicapped , stalking , masturbation , anonymous homosexual encounters , serial killings and the unspeakable horror of getting . . . " it " . . . caught in one's zipper . if that kind of subject matter seems more likely to have you grimacing than guffawing , don't say i didn't warn you : there's even more where that came from . viewers with less delicate sensibilities , on the other hand , may be hoarse at the end of a relentlessly raucous two hours . it's unfair to spoil the moments with specifics ; half the fun in there's something about mary comes from i-can't-believe-they-did-that reactions . suffice to say that nearly everything works , from the surrealist use of alt-rock icon jonathan richman as the film's narrator/troubadour to the subverted romantic montage , from the perfectly-pitched charm of diaz ( rapidly becoming the most appealing screen actress of her generation , if she's not there already ) to the goofy appeal of stiller . there's something about mary recalls blazing saddles-era mel brooks , or airplane ! -era zucker-abrahams-zucker -- back-brain humor which will be as dumb and/or offensive to some viewers as it is hilarious to others . brilliant , it ain't ; brilliantly executed , it is . there are a couple of slow patches in there's something about mary , which probably runs longer than advisable at nearly two hours . when it pauses long enough to pretend that the character relationships matter , or to explain a rather unnecessary plot twist , the film could have you shifting in your seat . fortunately , they're only momentary distractions between laughs that beat down your logical objections , building and building until they add up to more laughs than you can remember at the movies . i'm not proud of the fact that i'd rather sit through there's something about mary again than any one of the inspid romantic comedies of the past five years that generally passed for comic entertainment , but i would . i'll worry about what that means tomorrow . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
in the world of animated feature films , only one production company has managed to come close to the standard set by disney--the one headed by don bluth . fortunately , thumbelina breaks this non-disney trend , presenting a theatrical experience that is lively and enjoyable for both children and adults . disneys animated movies have a threefold strength : the quality of the animation , the energy of the songs , and the clarity of the plot . in all of these areas , thumbelina is close , but not quite up to the level of the little mermaid , the weakest of disney's recent entries . the animation is crisp and visually striking , with careful attention paid to details--a trademark of both bluth and disney . thumbelina is perhaps not as completely-realized as arielle , belle , or jasmine , but she's far better drawn than the women populating all the fringe big-screen cartoons . barry manilow's music isn't as immediately recognizable as that of alan menken , but he does manage a worthy tune or two . one song in particular , " let me be your wings " , co-written by manilow with bruce sussman and jack feldman ( who partnered with menken for disney's live-action newsies ) , is a standout , and every bit the equal of beauty and the beast's title track or aladdin's " a whole new world . " the storyline of thumbelina , adapted from the popular hans christian andersen fable , is relatively uncomplicated , and makes excellent material for an animated romance/adventure . there are several occasions when the plot seems rushed , especially towards the end . while children most likely won't notice this , adults will , although it shouldn't detract much from anyone's enjoyment of the film . the vocal talents of several well-known actors are made use of in thumbelina . carol channing is ms . fieldmouse . entertainment comes in many forms , and thumbelina is among the frothiest available . but the best thing is that not only is it fun--an eminently watchable--but it's a perfect " family film , " capable of pleasing both children and their parents . with the exception of disney fare , this has become an increasingly-rare commodity , and when an opportunity such as this occurs , it should be taken advantage of . 
since citizen kane mysteriously showed up at our local multiplex -- even the manager had no idea why they booked it , i decided to attempt to forget everything i knew about it and to try to look at it as the first viewers might have back in may of 1941 . even the greatest films , and citizen kane is universally considered to be the best or at least one of the best , were once just the latest picture playing at the local bijou . the audience may have known something of the story ahead of time , but they likely did not expect its greatness . oscar wells , then a beaming , fairly trim young man , directed citizen kane , played the starring role and cowrote the script with herman j . mankiewicz . the film's opening has the look of a creepy old gothic horror movie . this eerie tranquility is shattered by the blare of a newsreel . theaters then featured newsreels along with the double feature and the latest installment of some serial . the newsreel in citizen kane , although slightly comical , gave a documentary feel to the production , what we would call a docudrama today . since the movie was a slam at the life and times of william randolph hearst , a fact the audiences then were likely to have heard , the newsreel approach gave the film an immediate intimacy and accessibility . having just weathered the great depression , the viewers were likely to have identified with the film's ridicule of ostentatious wealth . just as the audiences were probably enraged at this waste of money , having recently worked their way back from poverty , they were also quite likely jealous . " it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing . " this hinted to the viewers that the film wasn't just some elaborate mystery and that they should not feel cheated if rosebud turns out not to be very dramatic after all . audiences now know the answer to the mystery , but then it must have been intriguing . viewers must have had numerous theories since the movie doesn't give any substantial clues until almost the very end . once the secret is revealed , it seems at first to be unimportant , almost trivial . upon closer reflection , the importance that kane attaches to it is a key to understanding his character or what we today would call the inner child . the radical cinematography by gregg toland must have shocked the audiences then as it mesmerized them with its offbeat angles , dramatic lighting and stark use of shadows and silhouettes . the seamless editing by mark robson and robert wise , who would go on to become a great director , moves forward and backward in time without ever losing continuity . filled with intriguing layers , the story of kane's life becomes an onion that the movie keeps peeling . " if the headline is big enough , it makes the news bigger , " kane says , knowing then the power of the press to make news when before there was just a tiny , inconsequential story . with today's tabloids being so prevalent this would be a line seemingly more tailored to today's viewers . the movie shows this transformation with great finesse . the best-staged sequence in the movie may be the breakfast table conversations with his first wife . within just a few minutes we watch kane's marriage going from puppy love to bitterness to death as the couple refuses to talk . as a politician , he is an old-fashioned , moneyed liberal who rails about giving the little people a voice . that is certainly something easier for audiences to understand then as opposed to now . citizen kane has so much to recommend it that it is hard to guess how the first audiences must have felt . maybe they felt as we do today , in awe of having witnessed a masterpiece while realizing how incredibly entertaining it was . it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for any kid old enough to care to see it . 
it's probably no stretch to say that casablanca , arguably america's best-loved movie , has had more words written about it than any other motion picture . over the years since its 1943 release , the legends and rumors surrounding the making of the film have generated almost as much attention as the finished product . some of the best-known and most often repeated tidbits include producer hal b . wallis' near-casting of ronald reagan and ann sheridan as rick and ilsa , the " double script finale " ( one version had the ending as filmed ; the other , unproduced version had rick and ilsa together ) , and the reported backscreen tension between several of the principal actors . ultimately , however , while it's fascinating to examine and dissect all that went into the making of casablanca , the greatest pleasure anyone can derive from this movie comes simply by watching it . aside from some basic knowledge of recent world history , little background is needed to appreciate the strength and power of the film . casablanca accomplishes that which only a truly great film can : enveloping the viewer in the story , forging an unbreakable link with the characters , and only letting go with the end credits . unlike many films that later became classics , casablanca was popular in its day , although some officials at warner brothers were convinced that it would be a box-office failure . the movie earned 8 oscar nominations , of which it won three ( best screenplay , best director , and best picture ) . ironically , however , the best-known bit of dialogue from casablanca , " play it again , sam , " isn't even in the movie . like captain kirk's " beam me up , scotty , " it's an apocryphal line . the closest the movie gets is either " play it " or " play 'as time goes by . ' " i remember the first time i saw casablanca , remarking how " modern " it seemed . while many movies from the '30s and '40s appear horribly dated when viewed today , casablanca stands up remarkably well . the themes of valor , sacrifice , and heroism still ring true today . the dialogue has lost none of its wit or cleverness . the atmosphere ( enhanced by the sterling black-and-white cinematography ) , that of encroaching gloom , is as palpable as ever . and the characters are still as perfectly-acted and three-dimensional as they were more than fifty years ago . bogart and bergman . the actors are both so perfectly cast , and create such a believable level of romantic tension , that it's impossible to envision anyone else in their parts ( and inconceivable to consider that they possibly weren't the producer's first choices ) . ilsa's arrival in casablanca rips open the fissures in rick's shield , revealing a complex personality that demands bogart's full range of acting . as ilsa , bergman lights up the screen . most viewers know henreid as " the other guy " in the romantic triangle , and , while his performance isn't on the same level as that of his better-known co-stars , henreid nevertheless does a respectable job . but the best performance in the film has to be that of claude rains , who is simply magnificent . bogart and bergman are great , but rains is better . this is the role of a very impressive career and it's a shame that he didn't win the best supporting oscar for which he was deservedly nominated . another curious thing about casablanca is that hardly anyone ever talks about the director . it's not as if michael curtiz is a journeyman hack who got lucky here . curtis was a well-respected film maker and his work on casablanca is first rate , but , for some reason , few non- cineastes associate his name with this picture . it's not much of a stretch to say that hollywood doesn't make movies like this any more , because the bittersweet ending has gone the way of black-and-white cinematography . one of the things that makes casablanca unique is that it stays true to itself without giving in to commonly held perceptions of crowd-pleasing tactics . and because of this , not despite it , casablanca has become known as one of the greatest movies ever made . maybe the modern generation of screenwriters should consider this before they tack on the obligatory " happily ever after " ending . from time-to-time , someone tries to remake the film , but even the best re-tread has been less than a pale shadow of the original . the most recent attempt was havana , sydney pollack's ill-advised misfire . despite a good cast ( robert redford , lena olin , raul julia ) and a change in venue , this is clearly an updated casablanca , and casablanca isn't casablanca without bogart and bergman . so , although just about everyone involved in casablanca is dead , this film has withstood the test of more than a half-century to rise , like cream , to the top . one can only imagine that , in another fifty years , its position in the hierarchy of all-time greats will be even higher . - ingmar bergman 
like all the best historical fiction , this trilogy uses real characters and real events , but imagines and re-invents relationships and circumstances . the resulting narratives are complex and entertaining , featuring ample quantities of swashbuckling adventure while focusing on well-rounded characters and murky politics . while the three musketeers has been adapted more than a dozen times for film and television , this new version of the man in the iron mask is only the sixth ( the last was 1979's the fifth musketeer ) . the writer/director is randall wallace , who scripted braveheart for mel gibson . the problem with this movie is that wallace has attempted to squeeze a 500-page book into a 130-minute motion picture , something that can't be done without major sacrifices . the resulting product is high on melodrama and low on the character depth and political machinations that are the novel's strengths . the man in the iron mask is also surprisingly devoid of gripping adventure . although the basic plot follows that of the novel , the central characters , older versions of the four musketeers , have been simplified into generic heroes . their motives , as presented in the movie , are superficial . dramatically , the film is weak , and plays more like a soap opera than a screen adaptation of a classic novel . the costumes and set design are impressive , but they're all just window dressing . the plot has the hit-and-miss feel that one might expect from any attempt to cram so much material into such a limited running time . the characters aren't all that interesting , since much of their complexity has been stripped away to make them more familiar and appealing to today's movie-going crowd . ( for example , the aramis of the book comes close to being a villain , but the aramis of the movie is unquestionably heroic . ) the unfortunate result is that the first 90 minutes , which are primarily intended to be dramatic , come across as rather dull . only in the final half-hour , when we are treated to several displays of derring-do , does the man in the iron mask come alive . the somewhat stilted and occasionally- ripe dialogue doesn't roll easily off his tongue and , for the most part , he gives the impression that he's playing dress-up . those who found dicaprio inadequate in romeo + juliet will likely cringe at his work here . judith godreche , who was strong in ridicule , is reduced to a lifeless mannequin as louis' mistress , christine . and anne parillaud , who hasn't been impressive since la femme nikita , offers a flat interpretation of queen anne , louis' widowed mother . fortunately , the veteran actors playing the musketeers are far better , and they have the lion's share of the screen time . malkovich is as delicious as ever , and it's refreshing to see him in a role where the primary characteristic is nobility rather than psychotic behavior . gerard depardieu is delightful as the somewhat-fatuous porthos . and , as aramis , jeremy irons gives his most lively performance in a long time . while the last half-hour is exhilarating and recalls the best swashbuckling movies , the film takes a little too long to get there , and , along the way , is only moderately successful as an historical drama or an adventure . dicaprio's name will undoubtedly give this picture a box-office boost , but his two characters aren't the movie's focus ? the aging musketeers are . and those who are interested in learning how their stories end will find greater satisfaction in reading dumas' novel than in sitting through this thin adaptation . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
taylor hackford's the devil's advocate has many laudable qualities , but subtlety is not among them . and , in what is arguably the most believable aspect of the movie , the devil's advocate takes lawyer-bashing to its logical extreme by making lucifer the head of a prestigious law firm . see what i mean -- no subtlety . that being said , the devil's advocate is a highly-enjoyable motion picture that's part character study , part supernatural thriller , and part morality play . although the film isn't a landmark combination of unique elements ( viewers will find themselves reminded of both the witches of eastwick and the firm ) , it has a lot of energy and the rather long 145-minute running time passes quickly . co-writer tony gilroy ( the cutting edge , dolores claiborne ) , who was brought in by director hackford ( dolores claiborne ) to expand upon jonathan lemkin's original adaptation of andrew niederman's novel , has produced a script that transcends any one specific genre , criss-crossing back and forth from horror to satire to melodrama . kevin's approach to a trial isn't that it's a forum for justice , but a game to be won or lost -- and he is willing to do anything for victory , even if he knows that his client is guilty ( the official term for this kind of person is a " sleazeball " ) . of course , this is the kind of over-the-top role that pacino plays best , and his virtuoso performance comes complete with a pair of the kind of monologues that he does better than anyone else working in hollywood today . of all the recent approaches to this role , pacino's dracula-esque method stands alongside the work of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) as the most memorable . although the spotlight shines squarely on pacino , there are other actors in the film . and , while pacino's performance is the best , it's not the most surprising . there are times when reeves lacks the subtlety that would have made this a more multi-layered portrayal , but it's nevertheless a solid job . spicy chalize theron ( trial and error ) is fine as mary ann , bringing equal parts sex appeal and pathos to a surprisingly well-developed role . aside from pacino's performance , the greatest strength of the film is its delicious build-up to an operatic climax . and , although huge parts of the devil's advocate are overblown and overplayed , it's never as silly as it has the potential to be -- and this quality consistently keeps the picture out of the dangerous realm of self-parody . the movie's greatest weakness is its ending , which , by trying to be too clever , ends up cheating the audience of a legitimate conclusion . while there's a sense of closure , it's not an especially satisfying one . oddly enough , with two of the most high-profile horror films of the year ( scream 2 and an american werewolf in paris ) slated for a december release , the devil's advocate may be the best option for a " halloween flick , " and the pairing of pacino and reeves should assure it a healthy bow at the box office . it doesn't hurt that the script is more intelligent that one might initially suppose and that the storyline is developed better than the theatrical previews cause it to appear to be . the devil's advocate certainly has problems , chief of which is the subtlety thing , but pacino's performance is so fun to watch that it eclipses the most significant of them . " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
satyajit ray's 28th and last film , he died in 1992 , is one that he shot in radiant color , and is as close as you can come to being a masterpiece and not be one , it is much better than some of his recent films , which seemed to show his old-fashioned humanistic ideas of what a film should be like , to be in a decline with the modern theater goer's taste . this film moved me a great deal , as i found empathy with his deep feelings about the observations he has made regarding the affects of civilization . the plot is rather plain . this makes sudhindra more suspicious of him than before , as he thinks that he is certainly scholarly and articulate and well-travelled , but he might be this clever because he is really an impostor . the family has no other way of confirming in a hurry if this is really their uncle . ray's choice of traditional music and primitive folk dance numbers , especially when the uncle sees his niece dance with the women members of the santhal tribe , is pulsating to behold and a reminder to us that we shouldn't forget our roots . the opulence and warm-hearted nature of the film overcame the lack of real suspense the film had and its predictability . his light touch and simple human gestures with the camera , poured out a delightfully intellectual array of food for thought , allowing this film to be both visually entertaining and a homage to a great director's creative life , questioning and stirring up his audience to keep knowing more about themselves and the world they live in , as he leaves us with this last eloquent film , one that has his signature firmly on it . 
it was an age of sincerity . " i fake passion . i fake conviction . " director iain softley , whose only other films are the mediocre backbeat and the painfully unwatchable hackers , succeeds marvelously this time . " three's a charm " as they say . but with top-notch actors and a timeless story , he would have had to work hard to make it otherwise . if the movie sounds like martin scorsese's award winning the age of innocence , it should . the time period and the study of restrainedresponses are similar , which is not to say the results are the same . scorsese's characters are untapped volcanoes , never erupting but always on the verge . in contrast , as good as softley's presentation is , and it is quite good , his actors smolder rather than burn beneath their calm exterior . never in the wings of the dove does a character seem truly in danger of an unchecked explosion . any lack of perfection in the direction is more than made up by the other members of the film's crew . the english patient's academy award winning composer gabriel yared provides an abundance of dramatic music to punctuate almost every scene . jude's cinematographer eduardo serra gives the film a strikingly handsome look . and most of all , john beard's sets are nothing short of breathtaking . venice has never been more lovely . the excellent , but largely forgotten , actress elizabeth mcgovern plays milly's friend and traveling companion susan . mcgovern , from her first film , the brilliant and devastating ordinary people , has brought something special to any character she has played , but her career has never taken off . " you don't understand me , and i don't understand you , " complains merton to his true love kate . the entire age was like that . people avoided revealing themselves which guaranteed them little hope of being understood . the picture's fascination comes from watching people in torment over these social constraints . it is rated r for some sex and nudity . the movie would be fine for teenagers . i strongly recommend this moving story to you and give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
this moody minimalist told piece is seen through the lush eyes of the camera rather than told as a narrative . it is about repressed desires and a love affair that never really happens . they realize they are the victims in this marriage but can't act out their repressed feelings , they are too worried about what others might say and do not want to be thought of like their spouses . they seem satisfied to eat out together , almost touch each other , and to just sit together while talking . it shows how well-thought of they both are in their environments , which means so much to them . the film is a visual fashion show of beauty and taste . every shot is stylishly accomplished in a ritualised way . nat " king " cole sings a host of soft ballads that reflect the film's steamy mood , while the couple often get caught walking in a rainstorm , or riding in a cab together , or nearly touching hands , or brushing past each other on the stairs , or expressing through their facial gestures their feelings of love . " do you have a mistress ? " nothing that belongs to it exists anymore . " wong kar-wai ( days of being wild/chungking express/fallen angels ) has created a film about sexual frustration that leaves you hanging on every gesture for a resolution , but this very delicate romance ends without a fulfilling resolution . it is a film that is hard to put out of your mind ; and , a lot of the credit for that should go to the two big stars of hong kong cinema , leung and cheung , who are simply mesmerizing . 
a sophomoric action comedy with a distinctive australian flavor , relying on screw ups to provide the comic situations . should appeal to teenagers and to those who think like them , and for those who just like a madcap film and don't concern themselves with plot and character development . i'll give the film credit for having a lot of pep and for being quirky . it's much like ritchie's " lock , stock and two smoking barrels , " as its humor is of the physical kind equally mixing a crime caper story with dumb or , if you prefer , black comedy . the film doesn't know how to gracefully end , but it does end on an a too cutely done amoral note . this comes after a few more plot twists . it was shown at the sundance film festival of 1999 . it was a harmless entertainment venture , of limited value . it's one of many recent world-wide films about combining comedy in a urban crime pic , though a new type of pic for the aussies . this one is forgettable , but somewhat likable because of the lead characters . 
but until then , it just seemed like a very entertaining pop culture film , whose satire comes about in comic-strip form , as it tweaks the side of sensibility in favor of perversity . but then again , it is quite possible that the film is so polemic and so full of contempt for society , that its theme revolves around the scientists surviving in a wasteland anyway they can ( maybe a referral to t . s . if that is the case and i suspect it is , then this film becomes a more sublime work than i thought at first , chewing off more than what can be seen . its ideas do not completely vanish in flames by the film's end but just smolder , even though the film never veers from being nihilistic . the dutch-born paul verhoeven ( starship troopers/total recall/showgirls/basic instinct ) , a director i never thought much of before as being subtle , thoroughly hating his fascistic parody , starship troopers , and being only mildly accepting of his other sleazy films , directed this thriller with an eye to his staple signature as an auteur -- of misanthropy and lurid erotic behavior combined with mindbending special-effects . the special effects are truly stunning , as we watch the gorilla become invisible , as her body when it changes looks like one of those see-through bodies in an anatomy textbook . i might not have had much use for the creepy sebastian , but i understood his human defects : his selfish motivations and his sexual curiosity , as annoying as those faults may be , at least it is something that was explored by the director in his invisible man theme , something other filmmakers of invisible men films haven't done , giving fire to the role kevin bacon so ably played . i also found elisabeth shue to be alluring , offering beauty and vulnerability , a sense of feminine instinctiveness , intelligence and of endeavor , in a film that caught an hypnotic sense of cynicism and ran with it . the remaining cast members looked as if they would be part of a research team and filled the film with the proper atmosphere needed . this is not a slasher film per se but it could be , it had all the gore required for a movie appealing to teens looking for a film with a quick mindless thrill . i found it to be most like a pop culture treat ala hollywood , adding its own brand of vitriolic delights to the sci-fi/horror genre , which has spawned many films with much the same tendencies , such as " aliens " and " the fly ( 86 ) , " but none with the same erotic tendencies and magnificent special effects . this one's a visual delight , much more intense and sleazier than the other recent similar films of this type , but one that can only push the pop culture button so far , because what does it all mean seems to be lost in the hollowness of the story itself . 
even though there is little to eat at their place other than moldy ding-dongs , they always have an expensive stash of cocaine and other drugs . in what is supposed to be an indictment of the non-existent morals among some in the movie business , the characters spend little time on the job . the script by david rabe , based on his play , is unfocused and almost incomprehensible . perhaps it worked on the stage , but the film version is a disaster that is only made partially watchable by some wonderful ensemble acting by a talented crew , who play characters bent upon various forms of self-destruction . in his usual masterful performance kevin spacey displays what passes for sanity in an insane environment . " i'm a real person ! " that sean penn can do such overblown parts without overacting is a testament to his abilities . " i know i don't know what i mean , which is better than most people , " eddie confesses towards the end . the extremely talky script revels in its obtuseness , with easily half of the conversation being conducted on cell phones . most lines make no sense whatsoever , although some are so ridiculous that they are downright funny . phil is such a lowbrow that any intellectual activity might short-circuit his brain . mickey looks briefly like he will be affected but blows it off with a joke about how at least they didn't set the kid on fire . you'll probably feel the same way about the movie . " what's he talking about ? " this is a question that the audience will be asking themselves throughout most of the movie . it is rated r for pervasive drug abuse , sex , profanity and brief nudity . i would consider the film not acceptable for those younger than college age . 
swindle , the ( rien ne va plus ) ( director/writer : claude chabrol ; cinematographer : eduardo serra ; editor : monique fardoulis ; cast : isabelle huppert ( betty ) , michel serrault ( victor ) , francois cluzet ( maurice ) , jean-francois balmer ( monsieur k ) , jackie berroyer ( chatillon ) , 1997-france ) this is one of chabrol's poorer films , the fiftieth one for the 68-year-old french director . it has the look and script of a b-film ( even though it was written expressly for the two stars ) . chabrol is playful here , but his lifetime of running gags against the bourgeoisie and his attempt to make this a giddy film , just didn't hold up . but it was never clearly spelled out what their intimate relationship was , as chabrol likes to keep one guessing . it wouldn't surprise me if they were related that way . maurice is scheduled to bring the money to guadeloupe to be exchanged , and chabrol adroitly uses all his many years of filmmaking skills to show double-crosses and switches of bags , and how things can go violently wrong with even the best of schemes . but , it is mostly a story about the two characters , their needs and how they relate to each other . that forms most of the wry comedy . there is also interest as to how and if the swindle can be pulled off by the couple , who , at times , have not told the other what they are up to . this caper story seemed stale to me , even though it has a certain amount of charm . but it did not splash across the screen with verve and audacity as much as chabrol intended it to . the director seemed to try too hard to relive his past with many allusions to characters and inside jokes from his many films , with the old master pulling out his tricks of the trade from a hat with too much ease to be believable . 
an uneven production marred by some ethnic slurs against a black butler ( muse ) and by holes in the mystery story , yet had its moments of sheer joy and ends up being a below average entry but can still be enjoyed as your typical charlie chan formula mystery story . this part of the investigation was slapstick comedy and ridiculous . there were also a healthy dosage of slurs against the hindus ; such as , the cops saying : " they all look alike to me . " " how many more ali baba's are there ? " the film was not tightly scripted as the story just didn't make sense , making it not logical to follow who the chief suspects were and what they were up to . also , we never learn why the planes are being sabotaged . too many tacked on explanations still can't clear up all the discrepancies , but that shouldn't really matter to the die-hard fans of the series .
